Our financials sector specialist thinks XLF could have \nanother 20-25% upside given the many levers to the Trump Trade: less regulation, higher interest rates, higher vol, \neconomic growth, loan growth, etc. The asset sensitive regional banks are more of a pure play on a rates move but we \nview the larger cap banks as having multi-pronged upside given the aforementioned points. \nThat said, given the velocity and magnitude of the recent move and uncertainty around the impact and timing of \nTrump's policies, we believe options offer better risk-reward than being outright long financials stocks here.
