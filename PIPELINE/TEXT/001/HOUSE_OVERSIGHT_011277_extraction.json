Our financials sector specialist thinks XLF could have another \n20-25% upside given the many levers to the Trump Trade: less regulation, higher interest rates, higher vol, economic \ngrowth, loan growth, etc. The asset sensitive regional banks are more of a pure play on a rates move but we view the \nlarger cap banks as having multi-pronged upside given the aforementioned points. \nThat said, given the velocity and magnitude of the recent move and uncertainty around the impact and timing of \nTrump's policies, we believe options offer better risk-reward than being outright long financials stocks here.

We \nare seeing a seasonal increase in buybacks as we come out of the low seasonal month of the year (October) and should  \nsee increased buyback executions until year-end, another source of upside for the Cons Disc, Technology and Financials  \nsectors.  \nGlobal Positioning, Nigel Tupper, 11/14.
