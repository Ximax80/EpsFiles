He is now in prison after attempting to sell it for $50,000 (£31,000).\nEpstein, 58, was accused of sex offences by more than 20 under-aged girls. They alleged that after being recruited as\nmasseuses by aides including Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late tycoon Robert, they were seriously assaulted and\nthen paid hundreds of dollars.\nThe billionaire financier, who attended The Queen's birthday party in 2000, was sentenced to 18 months in prison in 2008,\nhaving secured a plea bargain that prevented full criminal trials. He later settled more than a dozen multi-million dollar civil\nlawsuits from his alleged victims out of court.\nThe previously undisclosed journal, however, “detailed the full scope and the extent of Epstein's involvement with underage\ngirls”, according to lawyers for several alleged victims.\nProsecutor of the Duke of York’s sex offender friend Jeffrey Epstein speaks of\nDuke of York pleads with government over links to dictator\n'assault’ (http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8407689/Prosecutor-of-the-Duke-of-Yorks-sexoffender-friend-Jeffrey-Epstein-speaks-of-assault.html)\n(http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8363180/Duke-of-York-pleads-for-government-support-overdinner-with-Tunisian-dictators-relation.html)\nIt contained the names of girls that Epstein allegedly abused in “Michigan, California, West Palm Beach, New York, New\nMexico, and Paris”, according to court papers.\nIt also listed extensive contact details for Epstein’s house guests, who had “no connection whatsoever” with alleged\noffences, including Mr Clinton, the former US President, and Mr Trump, the famous businessman.\nIt could not be confirmed last night whether the book contained contact details for the Duke. One lawyer for Epstein’s\nalleged victims said: “I would bet he is, because he is that good a friend”.\nThere is no suggestion that the Duke did anything wrong. However he has this week faced a string of questions about his\njudgment due to his association with a convicted child sex offender.\nEpstein kept 21 different phone numbers for Mr Clinton, including some for his assistant and also “Clinton’s personal\nnumbers”, the court papers state.\nAlfredo Rodriguez, a servant who “saw numerous underage girls coming into Epstein’s mansion for purported ‘massages’,”\ntook the journal and did not mention it to investigators.\n“Because of the importance of the information in the journal to the civil cases, Mr Rodriguez called it ‘The Holy Grail’,” the\ncourt documents state.\nHe attempted to sell the book to lawyers for $50,000 (£31,000) in August 2009 - by which time Epstein had already been\nsentenced and released from jail.\nThe lawyers contacted the FBI, who sent an undercover agent to buy the book from Rodriguez. He was then arrested and\ncharged with obstruction of justice.\nRodriguez, who said in sworn testimony that he was terrified of Miss Maxwell, also said he took the book as an “insurance\npolicy” to prevent Epstein making him “disappear”.\nHe was sentenced to 18 months in prison – the same punishment Epstein received for his sex offences – in June last year.\nHis wife, Patricia Dunn, told The Daily Telegraph that he was “sorry” for his error.\nDave Lee Brannon, an Assistant Public Defender who represented Rodriguez, said: “If this book had been produced when\nrequested, Mr Epstein’s sentence may have been significantly different.”\nDetails of the journal emerged in a lawsuit brought in Florida by Epstein against Brad Edwards, a lawyer representing\nseveral alleged victims.\nEpstein alleges Edwards was linked to a \"Ponzi scheme\" run by a colleague, which lured investors by falsely claiming\nEpstein had agreed to settle sex-offence lawsuits for hundreds of millions of dollars.\nEdwards rejects the allegation, which has already been dismissed by the Florida Bar.\n© Copyright of Telegraph Media Group Limited 2011",
