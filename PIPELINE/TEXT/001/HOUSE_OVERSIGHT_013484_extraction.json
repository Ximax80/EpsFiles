Osborne's personal message suggests skepticism about the event and the use of Peter Thiel's name. The forwarded invitation is from Auren Hoffman and Peter Thiel, detailing a bipartisan retreat for global leaders. A significant portion of the document is a long, partial list of influential individuals who were to participate in the 2013 version of the retreat, serving as references. The document contains multiple 'HOUSE OVERSIGHT' watermarks, indicating it is part of a congressional investigation file.",
