As a result, he is required to register as a sex offender. While \nhe wasn't prosecuted for additional charges, more than 40 girls under the age of 18 say they \ncame to his home and gave him massages. During the massages, they say, he masturbated \nand sexually assaulted them. \nBrad Edwards and Paul Cassell, attorneys representing two of his alleged victims, say in \nthe filing that the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of Florida of deliberately \nmisled the victims by telling them there was an ongoing investigation into their claims. \nHowever, they say, the office was concealing the fact that they already had signed a \n-osecution deal with Epstein. \n-ding to the motion, the U.S. Attorney's office in January 2008 and May 2008 sent \"false notification\" letters in to \nin's alleged victims saying \"(t)his case is currently under investigation.\" However, the office had signed the agreement \nEpstein in September 2007. \nittorneys want a court hearing during which they will ask that the agreement be invalidated because it violated the \nis' rights. In the motion, the attorneys claim the agreement is illegal because the government did not protect the \nIressionally mandated rights of victims before it entered this agreement.\" \ndge grants the request, Epstein could be charged by the U.S. Attorney's office. If he were charged and convicted on \nal charges, he could be sentenced to 10 years to life for each charge. \n-ding to the motion, \"The only reason that the (U.S. Attorney's office) concealed the existence of the non-prosecution \nr'nent from the victims was not to comply with some legal restriction, but rather to avoid a firestorm of public \n)versy that would have erupted if the sweetheart plea deal with a politically connected billionaire had been revealed.\" \nValle, special counsel for the U.S. Attorney's Office Southern District of Florida, in an email to the newspaper that the \nkttorney's office will respond in court filings. \never, as we stated more than two years ago in July 2008 in our response to the plaintiffs' then-emergency petition for \ncement of the Crime Victim Rights Act, the CVRA was not violated because no federal charges were ever filed in the \nlem District of Florida,\" Valle said. \"Because the matter remains pending in court, it would be inappropriate at this time \nwide additional comment on the merits of the current motion.\" \nTC 1-1 DACTC• \nRemember me: (51 \nl[ \nJUSTJOBS] \nU.S. ATTORNEYS CHART (hteractivel \nii \nTrack leadership changes in the 93 U.S. Attorney \noffices, with Bush holdovers and Obama \ncandidates. \nCOVI NGTON \nCOVINGTON & BURLING LLP \nRecognized for its Leading \nWhite Collar Crime and \nAnti-Corruption Practices by \nChambers and Legal 500 \nDecisions about who, where and how \nto prosecute have always been—and \nmust remain—the responsibility of the \nexecutive branch.\" - Attorney General \nEric Holder discussing pressure from \nmembers of Congress to prosecute \nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed before a \nmilitary commission rather than in \nhttp:/ /www.mainjustice.com/2011 /03/22 /attorneys-say-miam i-prosecutors-violated-crime-victims'-rights-act/ \nPage 1 of 2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013406 \nAttorneys Say Miami Prosecutors Violated Crime Victims' Rights Act I Main Justice 4/7/11 1:38 PM \nI \nfederal court. \nlama To Tap Non-Profit Head For DOJ Crime Victims Post \nwmakers Bemoan Lack of Funding For Victims' Rights \npsecutor Who Violated Rights of Islamic Groups by Accident is Now U.S Attorney \nmocratic Donor Violated Spirit of Election Laws, LA Prosecutors Say \nderal Prosecutors Violated Laws, Ethics Rules in 201 Cases Since 1998, Study Finds \nLDER POST NEWER POST \n'erez Asks States to Help Enforce ADA Protections for Facing Hiring Freeze, Kansas U.S. Attorney Wants More  \ntudents Lawyers  \nnents are closed \nle I About I Advertise I Jobs I Privacy Policy I Terms of Use \nDEPARTMENT NEWS \nSES \nAssociate Attorney General Tom Perrelli Speaks at \nthe Department of Educationa00s Gender-Based \nViolence Summit \nComverse Technology INC.

If that happens, it could open up the 58-year-old \nPalm Beach billionaire to a slew of federal charges involving sex \ncrimes with minors that were set aside by the agreement. \nThe motion, filed Monday in federal court in West Palm Beach, \naccuses the U.S. Attorney's Office of deliberately misleading the \nvictims by telling them the investigation was ongoing, while \nconcealing they had already signed a deal with Epstein. \nAccording to the motion, the U.S. Attorney's Office sent \"false \nnotification\" letters in January 2008 and May 2008 to the victims \nsaying \"(t)his case is currently under investigation\" after the \ngovernment had signed the agreement with Epstein in September \n2007. \n\"The only reason that the (U.S. Attorney's Office) concealed the \nexistence of the non-prosecution agreement from the victims was \nnot to comply with some legal restriction, but rather to avoid a \nfirestorm of public controversy that would have erupted if the \nsweetheart plea deal with a politically connected billionaire had been \nrevealed,\" the motion says. \nIf Epstein were found guilty on federal charges, statutory penalties \nranged from 10 years to life. \nInstead, the sealed pact was part and parcel of Epstein's \nacceptance of a state plea deal, where he received an 18-month \nsentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting \nprostitution. He served 13 months segregated in a vacant wing of \nthe county stockade and was let out on work release six days a \nweek for up to 16 hours a day. \nEdwards and other attorneys fought in court for a year before \nsuccessfully getting the agreement unsealed in September 2009. \nMore than 30 minor girls were identified as Epstein's victims in the \nnact \nSite Q Web \n1.

They are \namong more than two-dozen underage girls who filed lawsuits or \nsettled claims against Epstein, alleging they were lured to his Palm \nBeach mansion to give him sexually charged massages and/or sex \nin exchange for money. \nThe motion filed Monday says the agreement is illegal because the \ngovernment did not protect the \"Congressionally mandated rights of \nvictims before it entered this agreement.\" \nAlicia Valle, special counsel for the U.S. Attorney's Office Southern \nDistrict of Florida, said in an e-mail that the U.S. Attorney's Office \nwill respond in court filings. \n\"However, as we stated more than two years ago in July 2008 in our \nresponse to the plaintiffs' then-emergency petition for enforcement \nof the Crime Victim Rights Act, the CVRA was not violated because \nno federal charges were ever filed in the Southern District of \nFlorida,\" Valle said. \"Because the matter remains pending in court, it \nwould be inappropriate at this time to provide additional comment on \nthe merits of the current motion.\" \nThe attorneys reference e-mails and letters from the federal office to \nEpstein's lawyers acknowledging the government's legal obligation \nto inform victims about the pact. The e-mails are redacted in the \nmotion because they are under seal. The attorneys filed a separate \nmotion Monday to unseal the correspondence. \n\"The reasonable inference from the evidence is that the U.S. \nAttorney's Office wanted to keep the agreement a secret to avoid \nintense criticism that would surely ensued had the victims and the \npublic learned that a billionaire sex offender with political \nconnections had arranged to avoid federal prosecution for numerous \nfelony sex offenses against minor girls,\" the motion says. \"As part of \nthis pattern of deception, the U.S. Attorney's Office discussed victim \nnotification with the defendant sex offender and, after he raised \nobjections, stopped making notifications.\" \nEpstein sought \"a higher level of review\" within the Department of \nJustice, the motion says. \"A reasonable inference from the evidence \nis that Epstein used his significant political and social connections to \nlobby the Justice Department to avoid significant federal \nprosecution,\" the motion states. \nShare this article: \nCOMMENTS \nComments are closed \nNEWS \tSOCIETY \tWEATHER \tARTS \tADVERTISE \tSPECIAL SECTIONS \nReligion \tInsider \tSPORTS \tArts Calendar \tSERVICES \tPalm Beach Life \nArchives \tSocial Calendar \tPolo \tOBITUARIES \tSubscriber Services \tHome & Loggia \nProfilePalmBeach  Madoff \tFASHION \tWEF \tLIFESTYLES \tHelp & FAQ \tAutomotive & Yacht  Showcase \nSpecial Reports \tFashion Calendar \tBUSINESS \tLocations \tVisitors' Guide \nTown Council \tAnnouncements \tReprints \tSeason in Review \nFeral Cats \tOPINION \tBLOGS \tFood \tStaff \tHurricane Guide 2010 \nPlaza \tLocal Voices \tCOLUMNISTS \tWorvenue  th A \tPrivacy ic  Pol Y \tChamber of Commerce \nReach 8 \tLetters to the Editor \tPets \tAbout Us \tNewsletter \nHealth \tSubmit a Letter \tVisitor Agreement  Subscribe \nREAL ESTATE \nhttp:/ /www.palmbeachdailynews.com/news/attorneys-want-jeffrey-epstein-agreement-th rown-out-1338111.html Page 2 of 3 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013409 \nAttorneys want Jeffrey Epstein agreement thrown out 4/7/11 1:37 PM \nCopyright@ Thu Apr 07 13:33:34 EDT 2011 All rights reserved.

McKenna reserved ruling on whether the recording will be released to \nattorneys representing young women who were sexually abused by Epstein as minors. McKenna didn't \nlisten to the recording during the hearing. Fort Lauderdale attorney Brad Edwards and Utah attorney and \nlaw professor Paul Cassell are fighting to obtain the 22-minute tape on behalf of Epstein victim Jane Doe. \nShe has filed one of a dozen pending civil cases in federal court in West Palm Beach against Epstein. \nA status check is set for Thursday in those cases before U.S. District Judge Kenneth Marra. \nDoe could have settled the lawsuit for $50,000 but is asking for $50 million in damages, Cassell said \nTuesday. \"Jane Doe was repeatedly sexually assaulted over a lengthy period of time by this wealthy and \npowerful man,\" Cassell said. \nEpstein, 57, is currently under house arrest in his Palm Beach home after serving 13 months of an 18-\nmonth state sentence for soliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution. Nearly two dozen \nyoung women have filed lawsuits against the billionaire money manager -- some already settled -- all \nalleging Epstein sexually abused them as minors at his El Brillo Way home. \nCites reporter's protected privilege \nRush, of the New York Daily News, was present in the courtroom, but did not have to testify Tuesday. \nNeither did Fort Lauderdale private investigator Michael Fisten, also in the courtroom. Working on behalf \nof Epstein victims, Fisten discovered the existence of the tape and had a conversation with Rush about its \ncontents. \nRepresenting Rush and the newspaper, Washington attorney Laura Handman and New York Daily News \nattorney Anne Carroll argued the tape should not be released under any circumstances, citing reporter's \nprotected privilege. Rush told Epstein the conversation was \"off the record\" and has never published any \nportion of that conversation. But even if portions had been printed, the unpublished portions would still be \nprotected, Handman said. \nHandman cited cases where interviews were conducted in the presence of other people and privilege was \nnot waived. \nIn addition, Handman argued that Rush should not have to testify in court. \nThe ability for reporter's privilege to be protected is crucial in culling sources and gathering information for \nnews stories, Handman said. Reporting is all about give and take between the reporter and the source; \nthat's what reporters have to do, Handman said. \n\"This is so critical to news gathering,\" Handman said. \"Mr. Rush could find himself testifying in [many] \ncases just because he had the temerity to do some reporting on a very important story.\" \nThere is nothing helpful to Doe's case on the tape and \"Jane Doe is not referred to once in that tape,\" \nHandman said. \nCassell argued that the tape is \"critical in showing Epstein's lack of remorse.\" \nCassell described Epstein as a pitiless sexual abuser to Jane Doe and at least 30 other minor girls. Even \nthough Jane Doe is not referred to by name on the tape, Epstein refers to his victims as \"the girls\" and \nmakes disparaging remarks about them on the tape, Cassell said. \nTape played for others \nCassell said privilege does not apply because it was waived when Rush played the tape for three people \nand verbally divulged its contents to two others, including Fisten and Edwards, who also represents two \nother victims. But even if there is \"qualified privilege,\" Cassell says, it is outweighed by Doe's inability to \nobtain the information anywhere else and the jury's need to hear Epstein's own words about his lack of \nremorse. \nSince Epstein has exercised his Fifth Amendment right during questioning by victims' attorneys, the jury \nClassifieds \nReal Estate \nAdvertise \nAutomotive \n,Ifisotp \nDLO\n/CI \nby \nShannon Donnelly \nhttp://nLnewsban k.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_doci...ername=dkiesq&s_accountid=AC0111040620221012261&s_upgradeable=no Page 1 of 2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013411 \nPalm Beach Daily News: Archives 4/7/11 1:35 PM \nwill have no other way to hear Epstein's words in his own voice, Cassell said. \nDeadline for discovery in the Doe case is May 31, with the trial set for July 14. \nmdargan@pbdailynews.com \nCopyright (c) 2010 Palm Beach Daily News \nRefinance Rates at 2.650/0  \n$160,000 Mortgage for $659/mo.

Edwards represents Doe and two other Epstein victims. Edwards and Cassell are fighting to \nobtain the tape to further their case of sexual abuse by Epstein when Doe was a minor. \nEpstein, 57, was released from jail in July after serving 13 months of an 18-month state sentence for \nsoliciting a minor for prostitution and soliciting prostitution. Nearly two dozen young women have filed \nlawsuits against Epstein -- some already settled -- all alleging Epstein sexually abused them as minors at \nhis El Brillo Way home, where he is now serving house arrest. \nThe New York Daily News is seeking to keep the tape confidential, citing reporter's protected privilege. \nIn response, Cassell says the newspaper waived its protected privilege when Rush played the recording \nfor three people and described its contents to two others, including Edwards. \nIn addition, Cassell writes that privilege can't be applied in this situation because it doesn't involve an \nissue related to a confidential source. The person on the tape is Epstein. \nEven if there is \"qualified privilege,\" Cassell maintains it is outweighed by Doe's inability to obtain the \ninformation anywhere else and her \"compelling need to obtain Jeffrey Epstein's own words about his \nsexual abuse and lack of remorse.\" \nWhen reached by phone Wednesday, Anne Carroll, attorney for the New York Daily News, said she will \nanswer Cassell in a court filing. Both the New York Daily News and Doe have asked a federal court judge \nin Manhattan to listen to the tape in chambers to help determine whether privilege applies. \nEpstein and others who helped him procure minor girls for massages and sex acts have taken the Fifth \nAmendment in their depositions, stymieing Doe and the other victims suing Epstein, the documents say. \nMichael Fisten, an investigator working for Doe, discovered the existence of the tape in fall 2009. An \nauthor who had listened to the tape told Fisten that Rush had a tape recording of Epstein \"discussing the \nsexual abuse of minor girls.\" \nAccording to a sworn affidavit by Fisten, he called Rush, who confirmed he interviewed Epstein and made \na tape. According to Fisten, Rush told him that he compiled negative information from Epstein about his \nexploits with underage girls and how he eluded the justice system. But Fisten said that Rush told him that \nhis publisher, who knows Epstein, killed it after receiving a call from Epstein. \nFisten said Rush told him, among other things, that the following information was contained on the tape: \nThat Epstein said he went to jail in Florida for no reason and if the sexual abuse of minors had happened \nin New York, he would have only received a $200 fine. \nThat L.M., one of Edwards' clients who sued Epstein for sexual abuse as a minor, came to him as a \nprostitute and a drug user (meaning she came to him for sex, rather than him pursuing her). \nThat all the girls suing him are only trying to get a meal ticket. \nThat the only thing he might have done wrong was to maybe cross the line a little too closely. \nIn a sworn deposition, Edwards states that Rush disclosed much of the information contained on the tape \nto him in a conversation. \nEdwards said in his statement that the Rush interview is \"unique and not otherwise obtainable from other \nwitnesses because it can be used to prove perjury -- a federal crime. \nEdwards said Epstein testified in a deposition that he did not recognize the name George Rush from the \nNew York Daily News \"despite the fact that he gave a personal interview that we all now know to have \nbeen tape recorded.\" \nmdargan@pbdailynews.com \nStart or \nRenew Your \nSubscription \nThursday, April 7, 2011 \nSHINY SHOTS ADVERTISE \"NTACT US \nAdvertise \nAutomotive \nupdates in your e-mail \nSign up to receive \nour e-mail \nnewsletters here. \n- \nPalm Beach Daily News \nNEWSLETTERS \nSUBSCRIBE \nhttp://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&p_doci...ername=dkiesg&s_accountid=AC0111040620221012261&s_upgradeable=no \nPage 1 of 2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 013413 \nPalm Beach Daily News: Archives 4/7/11 1:32 PM \nEpstein \nHas 'come close to crossing a line.' \nCopyright (c) 2010 Palm Beach Daily News \nRefinance Rates at 2.650/0  \n$160,000 Mortgage for $659/mo.
