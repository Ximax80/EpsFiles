Time and the reading by others will tell whether this idea was realized. The Fetzer\nFoundation and Dr. Gailey have facilitated exploration into blends of science and\nspirituality, particularly in the context of personal meaning. They also have a history of\nsupporting serious work in this era’s most powerful and rigorous exercise in holism as\nrepresented by the mathematical and applied mathematical fields of modern dynamical\nsystems theory. Fetzer’s very special environment and years of dedication have\nencouraged the variety of personal meanings within science to emerge and be recognized\nas legitimate and important parts of the research enterprise. It would be difficult to imagine\na more propitious context for this effort.\nThe book is dedicated to my daughter Buna, and to my intellectual and creative\ncompanion, Dr. Karen Selz, whose deep and lovely mind wrote much more of this book\nthan is formally acknowledged.\n3\nCHAPTER 1:\nIN SEARCH OF THE MIRACULOUS\nMore than a half-century of naïve persistence and driven search for unity in\nthe biophysics of mind and personal spirituality as the basis for healing\ntransformation has led me into many laboratories. The motivation may have been\ngenetic. My father said that we were descended from several generations of Jewish\nmystics, none of them able to attain the salaried status of rabbi or cantor. These\necstatic men lived lives of peripatetic eccentricity, stirring congregations with\nprovocative insights and uncomfortably personal inquiry. But only for a little while.\nSoon they were asked to leave the synagogue and often their Eastern European\nJewish townships called shtetels as well.\nMy father, in the first generation of our family without rabbis in over a\nCentury, was a businessman-musician, who in the early mornings studied Talmudic\ncommentaries. He taught me about why it was that most interpretations of the book\nby the rational, physician, lawyer, philosopher, Moses Maimonides, called Guide for\nthe Perplexed, were in error in their assumption that man cannot understand God’s\nnature with his mind. He took issue with the opinion that the union of a person’s\nintellect and Spirit with Him was not possible as long as a person was living. Ibn\nTibbon, Maimonides’ best-known early translator and interpreter, relegated the\ncognitive, analytical, physical and alchemical transformational sciences to the\nearthly, not spiritual realm. My father disagreed. He espoused the work of the 13 th\n4\nCentury proponent of a school of Jewish ecstatic mysticism, Abraham Abulafia,\nwhose interpretation of the Guide and his own Commentary on the Secrets taught\nthat the human mind, if transformed into a “state of active intellect,” could become\none with Spirit, realizing the Kingdom of God in rational mystical experience in a\nstate of excitement with new ideas. The new consciousness achieves deep\nknowledge of both the “upper” and “lower” realms of what he called “reality” both\nspontaneously and directly. He said that without personal transformation, this\nknowing is not possible.\nAbulafia’s lesson was that the mundane intellect of man has the potential for\ntransformation into another kind of mind in a spiritualization of thought. This occurs\nvia developmental stages that begin with intellect and imagination and culminate in\nwhat he called prophetic emanations. The exercises leading to this transformation\nare to be strongly willed and practiced with regularity. This work results in ascension\nto an ecstatic state accompanied by great intuitive powers, which Abulafia called\n“prophesy.” Ibn Adret, the Chief Rabbi of Spain at the end of the Thirteenth Century,\nbanished Abulafia from the Country, a Century before the Spanish Inquisition\nousted all the Jews.\nFollowing what my father said was required in the practice of Kabbalah, a\n13 th Century tradition of esoteric and mystical interpretations of the Scriptures, I\nlearned the secret meanings of each of the twenty-two letter Hebrew alphabet.\nMuch like the Platonic view of mathematics, that it existed before the physical\nuniverse, these symbolic equivalences were believed to be eternal in the\ntranscendental realm. One of the rare written accounts of this oral tradition is in the\nthirteenth-century Hebrew Book of Splendor called the Zohar which describes the\nHebrew alphabet as the heavenly code of the cosmos.\nI learned that the Tegragrammaton’s repeated letter Hei, being fifth in the\nHebrew alphabet, represents the number five. In the Kabbalistic tradition, Hei\nimplicates the functional five-partition of the human inner self or soul. The five parts\nare: nefesh, instinctual drives; ruach, mood, affect and emotions; neshamah,\ncognitive activities of the mind; chayah, efforts to understand and attain\ntranscendence; yechidah, experiencing the world as a cosmic unity. Later in life as\n5\na psychoanalytical neuroscientist with a computational bent, the partitions divided\nthoughtful, forewarning forebrain from automatic and stereotyped hind brain, the\nsignal analyzing thalamocortical system from the emotional and impulsive brain\nstem-limbic, the symbolically logical left from intuitively geometric right\nhemispheres. We divide the neurotransmitter moods of dopamine aggression from\nthe transcendentally erotic serotonin and the organized dynamical states of\nperiodicity and quasi(multi)periodicity from the real world complexity of chaos. I\nlearned that it is comforting to divide an unknown whole into two or more\nunknowable parts.\nThe Jewish guru and Hebraic tutor of my childhood, Rabbi Isadore Kliegfeld,\nsmiled when I told him about my sudden loss of panic during nighttime Hebrew\nletter meditations. He said that I had had received personal evidence that these\npowerful symbols could call forth the transformational powers of God. He said that I\nhad been given a blessing, in Yiddish, a nachas. Maybe panic is not that far from\nthe transcendence of an activated mind.\nIn my tenth summer, behind closed door in a hot back bedroom, first by\naccidental touch and then by more systematic chaffing, I evoked a pleasurably\nurgent and yawning feeling that began in the lower part of my abdomen and back. It\nfilled me with thought emptying fullness that a sudden involuntary burst of pelvic\ncontractions found resolution in an hour or two of an unexplainable sadness. I had\nbeen struggling to understand my father’s well warn copy of William James’s\nVarieties of Religious Experience and I wondered if I had been visited by one of the\naltered states he described. Was this what he meant by a transformative\nexperience? A few months later, a late night meditation produced physical\nevidence, a thick, sticky, salty sweet stuff that by morning stuck my sheets together.\nLater that year, in my father’s library, I found a translation of the 1500 BCE Egyptian\nBook of the Dead. It contained a creation myth of two Gods in which “rubbing with\nmy fist, my heart came into my mouth and I spat forth Shu and Tefnut.” Psalm 23,\nread rather regularly in Sunday school, began to make me wonder about the\nmeanings of“…rod and staff that comforts…” and what was meant by “…my cup\nrunneth over.” Among the ten regions of the Zohar, connecting the inner world of\n6\nman to the upper world, is the tree of ten sefirot in which Yesod , the phallus,\noccupies a central place. Now we’re allowed to know that G-spot stimulation of the\npara-urethral glands in the female can result in spurt as well as a cup that runneth\nover.\nOther occasions of the temporal disappearance of the self-conscious I\noccurred while doing the theorem and proof work of high school geometry. Axioms\nand the rule bound processes of deduction created difficult journeys from that which\nwas given to what should be found. Rocking back and forth in a desk chair for\nhours, chewing on fingernails, cuticles and pencil ends, time disappeared in a none\nself aware state of work-a-day well-being. Sri Aurobindo’s Bhagadvad Gita\ndescribed this state as one of the rewards of karma yoga. Abulafia’s Kabalistic\nSchool emphasized the importance of hitbodedut, detachment and seclusion in\nconcentrated thought, as a technique for the attainment of spiritual “intensification.”\nStacks of lined yellow paper piled up full of blind alleys as I lived in humbling\ndumbness. One of my teachers of mathematics described it as the working\nmathematician’s dark night of the soul. A breakthrough to a route from premises to\nproof brought an expansive rush.\nEngagement in a struggle to fuse two differing contextual worlds may be\ntransporting. Geometric visions can be used to do imageless algebra in a brain\nstate that feels like intuition. The brain does something like this: Let the number of a\nsequence of unit squares, each side of measuring 0 to 1, be the denominator of a\nseries of fractions, say fifths. Now put five of these boxes in a row. Then the\nsequence of all possible fifths, 0/5,1/5, 2/5,..5/5, is inscribed by cutting the vertical\nsides of the five sequential squares with a diagonal from the lower left of the first\none to the upper right corner of the last. This line cuts each sequential square’s\nfront boundary with vertical lengths, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4…1.0 in a series of decimal\nfractions equivalent to the sequence of all possible fifths, the proper fractions 1/5,\n2/5…5/5. It was Abulafia’s kabalistic belief that symbolic, (algebraic), operations in\n(geometric) spaces can unify the “upper” and “lower” worlds in the eternal tensions\nbetween the body and soul, the inner world and the cosmos, the conflict making the\nglobal system both sensitive and stable. The geometric-topological approach to\n7\nmodern dynamical system’s theory describes a convolution of the expansive\nmotions (as in the upper world) and contractive motions (as in the lower world)\nembedded naturally in the curved time and space geometries of what are called\nhyperbolic spaces. Each point in this space can be visualized as a little saddle in\nwhich orbital flows from pommel and back flow down to the seat, bringing points\ntogether in contracting motion, and flows away from seat down along the sides are\nexpanding the distance between nearby points.. In the middle of the saddle,\nsimultaneously expansive and contracting orbits demonstrate hyperbolic stability\ncomposed of intersecting destabilizing and stabilizing influences. Loss of this\ncountervailing hyperbolic dynamical stability results in global system\ntransformations called bifurcations and/or phase transitions.\nTransformation as a loss of stability is a theme of a recent poetic translation\nof portions of the Zohar called Dreams of Being Eaten Alive by David Rosenberg.\nHe writes that at some time in the difficult journey through the oftenincomprehensible\nZohar, in order to gain entrance to the kabalistic cosmos, there\narose what he called “heartbreak.” “No matter how much intellectual study is\ninvolved, the reader cannot understand the text unless he or she has offered his\nheart to be broken on the altar of poetry…and prayer.” Surrender may be the source\nof the strange, uplifting feeling of worked through dumbness.\nMy mother, once a conservatory teaching assistant in piano, sat beside me\nwhile I practiced almost daily, weekends included, from the age of two until the\nmidteens. Her quiet analytic counter-point sounded mathematical, “You can hear\nthat that this harmonic progression goes through intervals of fourths of dominant\nseventh chords.” I felt the persistent lack of harmonic resolution as growing tension\nin my groin. “If you transform each of the 12 notes in a chromatic scale, multiplying\nit by five (in what mathematicians call) mod 12 (the numbering system goes from\none to twelve, not ten, before it repeats), one can recover the circle of fourths, the\ncommonest harmonic chord progression in music.” Though her computational talk\nsupported rational thought, in my adolescent heat, the addition of Charley Parker’s\nflatted fifth and ninth to the dominant seventh chord led suddenly somewhere else\nand she knew it. Hearing my arrangement of a Beethoven piano piece become a\n8\nmix of classical and modern jazz themes that I called “How High the Moonlight\nSonata,” she laughed lasciviously as though tickled by this sensual violation of\nmusical canon. A boogie-woogie Bach two and three-part invention brought more\nexcited disapproval.\nMysterious are the conditions of attentive (preoccupied) and none attentive,\n(fugued out) disappearing time. I found a musical way for it to happen when\nimprovising: continue to shuffle a small set of notes that stay within the melodic field\nof the tonal center of an unchanging tonic chord. In contrast, most melodies and\ntheir chords leave the tonal center to which they return in harmonic and melodic\nprogression. We can call these conventional tonal centers unstable fixed points.\nThey are attractive repellers of melodic and harmonic expectation. It has been\nmathematically proven that these hyperbolic systems are globally stable. In\ncontrast, a melody that remains stuck in the tonic chord, a purely contracting stable\nfixed point, is technically a chant. Paradoxically, it can be shown that this kind of\nfixed point is globally unstable. Rigid things can more easily fracture. The rich,\naltered states of consciousness that emerge while hearing the beat of Tibetan\nmonks meditating, the Sufi chant-dances of Rumi and the John Coltrane and\nMcCoy Tyner’s endless, single chord, tenor/piano dialogues exemplify the\nbifurcation to hallucinatory new stuff arising spontaneously from the experience of\nunchanging repetition. Constant repetition of the conditioned (expected) stimulus\ndrove Pavlov’s dogs, especially those with “nervous temperaments,” into frozen,\ncatatonic states. Abulafia’s 1280 book on ecstatic techniques, Hayyei Ha’Olam\nHaBa, recommended the recitative rearranging of a finite set of Hebrew letters,\nfrontward and backward, many times, using prayer melodies, until “…the heart will\nsuddenly become aware of the intellectual, divine and prophetic…” and hitbodedut\nwill rest upon him. The instructions were “…combine letters (and associated musical\nnotes)… reversing and rolling them around rapidly until one’s heart begins to feel\nwarm.”\nIt was in my freshman year at Stanford University when I met Michael\nMurphy, later to co-found Esalon, the California center for mystical pursuits and\nnaked mud bathing. He is the author of Golf in the Magic Kingdom and with George\n9\nLeonard, Integral Transformative Practice. I watched him go through a dramatic\npersonal transformation after participating in Professor of Asian Studies, Frederick\nSpiegelberg’s seminar (with meditation lab) about Sri Arubindo’s interpretation of\nthe Hindu Bible, the Bhagavad-Gita. Shortly after the semester, he climbed into an\nabandoned tower on campus to continue his meditation. He remained there for\nseveral months, refusing to come down even after the Stanford Student Health\nService sent a medical school psychiatrist to investigate. I was more than curious\nabout how it was that this hard drinking, and like his brother Dennis, all night poker\nplaying, Phi Gamma Delta party boy, had suddenly become a transcendent ascetic.\nMy girl friend Mary and I signed up for Spiegelberg’s seminar in Indian\nReligions. We were made breathless by his accounts of administering a Rorschach\nTest to the Indian Saint, Swami Sivananda. He recounted discussions about God\nwith the artists Paul Klee and Max Ernst and the philosophers Rudolph Otto, Paul\nTillich, Martin Heidegger and Martin Buber. As homework, Mary and I practiced\nbreathing awareness mediation twice a day. During the year, Spiegelberg\nsponsored a visit by the aging but still very lively Aldous Huxley to our seminar. He\nalso brought us Alan Watts and several lecturers from the Jung Institute of San\nFrancisco. Shortly after hearing Huxley talk about the spiritual power of a particular\nexercise of will and loving thoughts, Mary and I began the daily practice of karessa,\nsome call it coitus reservatus. I was eighteen and she was nineteen. We found that\nwithholding an orgasm in order to achieve nirvanic extinction of all desires and\npassions was difficult. We spent hours in karessa meditation, trying to experience\nthe detachment described in the Bhagadvad Gita. This biblical explication of karma\nyoga told how it was that the warrior, Ardjuna, instructed by God Krishna in the form\nof his charioteer, was able to detach sufficiently to do his assigned job of killing\nwithout emotional involvement. Ken Wilbur, a modern, self proclaimed pandit, an\nacademically oriented articulator and intellectual justifier of the dharma, the spiritual\nwork of Hindu and Buddhist practice, contrasts the nirvana (literally “end”)\ncomposed of emptiness in time and space, dharma Kaya in which “…no objects are\narising…” with the lesson of the Bhagavad-Gita. Its message involved realizing\n10\nones spiritual unfolding within the stream of real time and space, finding emptiness\nin the world of form and inaction in the world of action.\nWe worked at karessa so ardently that there was barely enough time left to\ndo our assignments in biology and chemistry. In a darkened room, Mary and I lay\nlegs locked, lying on our sides, moving slowly and rhythmically, humming Om and\nwaiting for our ascension. We worked at making the journey through Sri Aurobindo’s\nsoul planes of higher mind, illumined mind, infinitive mind, over mind and finally, the\nsupermind of infinitely empty no mind. This somewhat unusual way to study for a\nthree credit course in Asian Studies at Stanford grew naturally out of the central\nmessage of Spiegelberg’s seminar that whereas “…deriving a universal theology is\nnot possible, having the universal experience is required for an understanding of\nany of the world’s theologies.” The controversial Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of\nNewark who teaches that Christian forms continue to evolve, John Shelby Spong,\nD.D. says, “…every biblical word represents an attempt on the part of our ancestors\nin faith to make sense out of a God experience in their time and place. The\nexperience …is eternal and real. The explanations will never be eternal and real.\nThey will last only as long as the (cultural) mind-set that created them.”\nMary got an A+ grade, topping Spiegelberg’s class with a final examination\nessay, which, in literary detail, described her episodes of samadhi, yoga’s state of\nunity with the creator. Her 25 page blue book contained accounts of walking fugues,\nspontaneously strong genital sensations, changes in tastes and smells, sudden\nfeelings of rising spinal-abdominal kundalini, middle of the night dreams of oceanic\norgasmic fusion with God. She failed to mention that she was describing her usual\npre-menstrual state.\nDuring these college years, I learned about two Isaac Newtons The first I met\nat elementary physics lectures; the unit was about how things worked called\nmechanics. Logically and computationally consistent but taken on faith, I learned\nabout an invisible field force between masses called gravity that decayed in strength\nlike the inverse of the square of their distances apart and operated in my intuitive\nworld like an electromagnetic spirit. Less occult were the expressions of\ngravitational fields as contact forces, computed for the tension in the string of a\n11\npendulum or the pressure of the floor on a weight resting upon it. Faith in this realm\ncame from exercises in physical object visualization followed by manipulation of\nself-consistent algebraic symbols. I learned about experiments attesting to the\n“reality” of these ghostly fields (that now include electric, magnetic and strong and\nweak nuclear forces), and yet it was the physicists that already believed them who\ndesigned the machines to demonstrate them. It was Gregory Bateson, Margaret\nMead’s houseboy, lover, photographer and social anthropologist who said, “Newton\ndidn’t discover gravity, he invented it.”\nOne college summer I found a second Isaac Newton, perhaps not so\nestranged from the first. He appeared in the form of a marble bust in the chapel of\nTrinity College at Cambridge University, holding the prism he had used to explore\nthe polychromatic properties of light like a talisman. In his essay called Newton, the\nMan, the early 20 th Century Cambridge Don and economic theorist, John Maynard\nKeynes, said that the Newton of the chapel followed “…certain mystic clues which\nGod had laid about the world to allow a sort of philosopher’s treasure hunt to the\nesoteric brotherhood.” Michael White’s biography, called Newton the Last Sorcerer,\ndescribed his work as an attempt to integrate the magic of the Old World with the\nscience of the New Age. Newton’s awe over what he saw as the wonders of the\nuniverse maintained him in private theological study throughout his life. Arthur\nWaite’s Alchemists Through the Ages describes how Newton’s alchemical\norientation toward the earth’s fundamental substances such as fire, air, wind and\nwater, their powers and potential for transformation, was joined imperceptibly with\nhis metaphysics and physics. In his hands, experimental observations involving\ngravitation, celestial mechanics and optics, though motivated by esoteric alchemical\ntheories, generated experimentally accessible phenomena and testable ideas.\nThe French mathematician, Jacque Hadamard, in his The Psychology of\nInvention in the Mathematical Field, said that mystical preoccupations were never\nfar from the minds of most of the English and European mathematicians and\nphysicists of the 18 th and 19 th Centuries. This orientation served as an impetus for\nthem to pay attention to the almost imperceptible whispers of their emergent\nthoughts. E.T. Bell, the historian of mathematics and mathematicians said even\n12\nDescartes, the essential Enlightenment rationalist, was responsive to his “…call of\nthe Spirit…” Napier the inventor of logarithms wrote an exegetical commentary on\nthe Book of Revelations. The mathematician and physicist, Pascal, believing that\ncontact with a religious relic had cured his terminally ill sister, wrote long tracks\nabout whether or not the Devil could work miracles. The great mathematician,\nCauchy, was known for his persistent efforts to convert fellow mathematicians to\nRoman Catholicism. Gauss, who was not particularly religious, said that a difficult to\nprove theorem did not result from hard work but “…the grace of God.” In letters\nbetween Liebniz, who along with Newton was the inventor of calculus, and a\nmember of the family of great mathematicians, John Bernoulli, used scriptural\nquotations and biblical diagrams as part of their theoretical correspondence.\nPerhaps the greatest mathematician of the 18 th Century (or ever), Euler, in his\nLetters to a German Princess, discussed the functional characteristics of spirits and\nthe connections between body and soul. Bell said Euler “…never discarded a\nparticle of his Calvinist faith.”\nIt was to the working out of a law of mechanics called “the principle of least\naction” that Ernst Mach attributed the beginning of the separation of physical\nmechanics from formal theology. The flavor of this change is captured in his 1893\nThe Science of Mechanics that stimulated Bridgeman’s 1936 more formal\nphilosophical analyses of physical theory, from a position that came to be called\noperationalism: the restriction of physical concepts to those definable in terms of the\nexperimental operations required to demonstrate or prove them. Mach said that\nthese events marked the move of formal metaphysical thinking about mechanics\nand the physical sciences more generally into the personal and private realm of\nbelief and meaning.\nMaupertuis, an eccentric friend of Frederick the Great and president of the\nBerlin Academy, proposed the principle of least action as evidence of the infinite\nwisdom of the Creator. As an early psychopharmacologist, Maupertuis\nrecommended the use of opium to facilitate creative thought and was famously\nparodied for doing so by Voltaire in his 1752 story in which he is portrayed as the\nnaïvely foolish Dr. Akakia. The physical law of least action belongs to a set of ideas\n13\nthat are called variational analysis. They involve the natural (or miraculous)\nselection of maxima or minima in quantifiable physical processes. Of all possible\ntwo-dimensional shapes with the same perimeter, the circle contains the greatest\narea; in three dimensions, it’s the sphere. In his Principia, Newton reports his work\ndetermining the optimal shape of round solids, with circles of revolution having the\nsame effective cross section, in order to minimize frictional resistance to gravity in a\nmedium.\nThe principle of least action says that imparting energy; say by a kick, to a\nphysical body on a rigid two-dimensional surface like the earth, results in it taking\nthe shortest route possible from its initial to final position. The related 1650 Fermat’s\n“principle of least time” is about light. As Feynman explains in his Lectures in\nPhysics, “…out of all possible paths that light might take from one point another,\nlight takes the path that requires the shortest time.” Feynman, using elementary\nrelations from high school geometry, proved that the least time principle could lead\ndirectly to Snell’s law of the refraction of light at the interface of two different\nconducting media such as air and water. His analogy was the optimal choice of the\npath to take in order to rescue a pretty girl drowning in the ocean. Whereas the\nshortest distance to the girl leads directly into the water, faster running along the\nbeach to the point that minimizes the distance required for the intrinsically slower\nrate of swimming increases the distance traveled but reduces the time required to\nreach her.\nEuler attributed the optimization principle to an expression of the meaning\nand purpose of a loving God. Infused with this spirit, he developed mathematical\nmethods describing smooth variations in position of an object in motion, the Euler\ndifferential equation, in which differential coefficients are varied to prove the\nprinciple of least action for mechanical motion. He gave the law Maupertuis’s name.\nMach quoted Euler’s conclusion, “As the construction of the universe is the most\nperfect possible, being the handiwork of an all-wise Maker, nothing can be met with\nin the world in which some maximal or minimal property is not displayed.” Such faith\nbased mathematical formalisms were rejected by Joseph Lagrange, an early 19 th\nCentury mathematician, who, among many other things, proved that every natural\n14\nnumber could be expressed as the sum of at most four squared numbers. It was his\nstrongly held opinion that metaphysical speculation was both foreign and inimical to\nthe conduct of mathematics and science. His work in the calculus of variations led\nto the development of a system of algebraic manipulations seeking the value of\nconstants, Lagrange multipliers, in place of solving Euler’s differential equations. It\nmakes it possible to immediately write down a computable expression for the\nmaximum of a mathematical equation. The technique is now routinely taught to high\nschool students and with no mention of the role of belief in the perfection of God in\nits discovery.\n* * *\nI was a fortunate freshman medical student. After a visit to his office and a\nstimulating discussion about some of the correspondences between the ideas of\npsychoanalysis and neurobiology, Robert Heath, Tulane Medical School’s Gary\nCooper-like charismatic chairman of the psychiatry department, offered me a place\nin his animal and human neurophysiological laboratory. Between classes, evenings\nand weekends, I used a Horsely-Clarke apparatus, one of the world’s first\nstereotaxic devices. It allowed the precise placement of electrodes into functionally\nspecific regions of a cat’s brain. The electrodes were cemented to the skull in place\nand their wires connected to a device by which the frequency, amplitude and wave\nshape of the electrical stimulation could be oscilloscopically monitored and\nelectronically controlled as the conscious cat walked around the room. I spent hours\nobserving and recording changes in spontaneous behavior that followed activation\nof various nuclei in the cat’s brain with small electrical currents.\nDeep in the part of brain that resides in the upper neck, called the lower brain\nstem, the region thought to regulate functions such as breathing, heart rate, blood\npressure, gastrointestinal motility and global states of consciousness such as\nwakefulness and sleep, I found stimulus sites that, after 15 seconds of electrical\nactivation, led to several minutes of hissing and objectless rage. One cat attacked\nan empty chair. These regions when activated also inhibited spinal reflexes such as\n15\nthe knee jerk of the standard neurological examination. Such phenomena were\nalready well known in the late 1930’s in what W.R. Hess and later John Flynn,\nfollowing electrical stimulation of cats in the lateral hypothalamus, called\n“hypothalamic rage.” In the late 1940’s and 1950’s, work by National Institutes of\nMental Health’s Paul MacLean attributed it to the actions of parts of the emotional\n“limbic” brain, particularly the fear-rage-attack coloring of experience by the\ntemporal lobe’s amygdaloid nucleus. Modern imaging studies in man have shown\nthat this source of emotional coloring is activated by new information, even before\nthe more rational parts of the neocortical brain processes it. How we feel about\nsomething new arises before what we think about it. These survival-oriented states\nof fight or flight are known to be biologically universal and demonstrable in even\nsingle cell organisms.\nA greater contribution to my brain metaphysics followed observations that\nafter several seconds of stimulation of other brain stem sites, the cats became alert\nbut quiet, staring into space for several minutes. Then, they circled slowly and\ncurled up on the ground. This was followed by several minutes of grooming and\nloud purring. Difficult to handle cats became transiently tame, some coming close\nfor petting. I found that these same sites also increased the amplitude and reduced\nthe threshold for the cat’s knee jerk reflex. Responsiveness increased with\ncalmness. Particularly interesting was the finding that electrical induction of this\npurring state could immediately stop on-going stimulation-induced episodes of\nhissing rage. I referred to these experiments with my friends as my\nneurophysiological studies of Old Testament vengeance and New Testament\nforgiveness. It seemed that the hissing rage would produce eye for an eye and a\ntooth for a tooth hypertension, the talon principle of the Old Testament and Koran.\nNew Testament forgiveness would yield low blood pressure health and Jesus was a\nhealer. It was about this time in the early 1950’s that Northwestern University social\npsychologist, Jim Olds, found that rats could be trained to push levers to obtain\ncurrent delivery via electrodes in various parts of their brains. Shortly after, Joseph\nBrady, then of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, showed that squirrel\nmonkeys would do the same. With depth electrodes attached to wires running to a\n16\nminiaturized electronics box strapped to their belts, some of Robert Heath’s\nschizophrenic patients spent hours pressing their switches with beatifically\nexpectant smiles.\nIt was after several months of cat experiments that Professor Heath\nsuggested that we spend some time interviewing a hospitalized, chronically ill\nfemale patient, Donna, before and during the time she was being studied with\nrecording and stimulating depth electrodes in the human neurophysiology\nlaboratory. Donna, bony thin in a lose fitting green hospital gown and sandals, had\ndark red toenails, blonde hair and eyes shadowed darkly. In her mid-thirties, she\nhad never married and, when she could, worked as a beautician. She told us that\nsince her menarche at 13, she increasingly often had episodes of spontaneous\necstatic rushes along with sudden visions of strong white light. She attributed these\nexperiences to visitations of “…an unseen Christ.” She showed me a stack of\nnotebooks filled with hand written accounts of her religious experiences\ninterspersed with biblical quotations and difficult to follow discussions of what she\ncalled the Christian ideals underlying the Civil War. She read parts of it to us. One\nof her memorable stories was about being invited to a Children’s Crusade that had\nbegun in Georgia, led by a great grandson of Stonewall Jackson. “We were trying to\nfind the Lord to see if He would part the waters and open up an escape route from\nGeneral Sherman’s march to the sea.”\nFrom a relatively poor family of Southern Baptists in rural Louisiana, she had\nlived in a state psychiatric hospital for almost three years. Her diagnoses ranged\nfrom borderline schizophrenia to temporal lobe epilepsy. The collateral interviews\nwith her mother from several years before had been placed in the hospital chart.\nThey recounted that in the patient’s middle to late teens she had become suddenly\npromiscuous, frequently approaching strange men in city parks. Obsessed with\nfellatio and swallowing sperm, she told her mother that she was receiving a holy\nsacrament. More recently, the increasing incidence of ecstatic episodes and\ncompulsive note taking coincided with the complete loss of interest in sexuality in\nany form. Her talk was now full of moralizing detail about the shoulds and should\nnots of daily living. She referred to herself as a non-Catholic nun who was married\n17\nto Christ. The brain waves recorded from electrodes deep in her brain demonstrated\ntransient episodes of spiking in a midline limbic structure called the septum and in\nthe right hippocampus, deep in the temporal lobe. Paul MacLean and others since\nhave shown that electrical stimulation of these and related brain regions could\nproduce pleasure and grooming reactions in cats and prolonged penile erections in\nsquirrel monkeys.\nMany years later, I spoke about Donna with the Harvard professor of\nneurology, Norman Geschwind. He took me to his twice a week epilepsy clinic. In\nan effort to demonstrate what is now known as the Geschwind Syndromes of\nbetween seizure, inter-ictal personality changes in patients with temporal lobe\nepilepsy, he stood in front of the patients’ waiting room. In a loud voice, he asked\nthat all people keeping diaries and personal notebooks please stand up. Several did\nso, some displaying their notebooks in outstretched hands. The pages that I saw\nwere filled mostly with religious writing, biblical quotations and exclamation points.\nGathering the positive responders together, he asked them in turn what religion they\nwere. Several answered the question with the question, “When?” It turned out that\nmany reported having several experiences of religious conversion. Geschwind\ncalled them “Jamesian Episodes” after William James’ Varieties of Religious\nExperience. He then asked when was the last time they engaged in sexual activity.\nFor most of them, including those that were married, it had been years. Thought the\nmen said they were not impotent, experiencing early morning spontaneous\nerections, they claimed a complete loss of interest in sex though feeling warmly\naffectionate toward people generally. As he anticipated, the patients were\nemotionally intense and unstoppably loquacious, needing to speak at length about\ntheir moral philosophies. They persisted in following us around the clinic waiting\nroom, several speaking at once. In his lectures and papers, Geschwind called this\nlast feature, difficulty in separation, interpersonal “stickiness.” First reported by the\nFrench electroencephalographer, Henri Gastaut, a history of multiple ecstatic\nreligious experiences, increasing emotional intensity and lability, hyposexualilty (not\nimpotence), moralizing religiosity, compulsive and frequently poetic writing and\ntendency to cling to people is now called the Geschwind Syndrome of temporal lobe\n18\nepilepsy. Some say it is relevant to the likes of Apostle Paul, Sister Teresa and\nJoan of Arc.\nOne evening in the human neurophysiology laboratory, I was invited by Dr.\nHeath to join him and several other brain scientists behind a two-way mirror to\nwatch an interview with Donna while electrical current was being put through her\nrecording electrodes. We watched and listened as a psychiatrist interviewed her\nabout her past. The patient was speaking about her childhood. Unseen by the\npatient, the neurophysiologist, with us behind the mirror, was intermittently pushing\nthe button evoking brain stimulation with very low current applied to the septum. Dr.\nHeath told me to listen for subtle changes or discontinuities in the flow of the ongoing\nconversation that he said might reflect alterations in her thoughts and\nfeelings. .\n“The first time we were allowed to take a break from Sunday school for the\nchurch service and I got to hear the choir and the pipe organ, I suddenly got a\nfeeling of happiness that I hoped would last forever. My Sunday school teacher told\nus how much Jesus loved us and that’s what the music made me feel like. For the\nfirst time in my life I felt completely safe.” Though the two way mirror I saw the\npsychiatrist nod silently. “When I learned about the real meaning of Christmas and\nEaster, it was frightening and beautiful.”\nWithin a few seconds after the neurophysiologist, behind the mirror and\nunseen by the patient or her interviewing physician, pushed the switch on the\nstimulus generator, the patient stopped talking. After a little more silence, her\ninterviewer encouraged her to continue,\n“You were talking about how beautiful the holidays were. Tell me in what\nways?”\n“I don’t want to talk about that anymore.” She blushed and looked very\nuncomfortable. The neurophysiologist’s hand remained on the switch. She\ncontinued to speak with her psychiatrist.\n“I have to ask you a favor and I don’t know why. I hope you don’t get upset.\nThe thought won’t leave me alone.” She seemed embarrassed even as her body\nrelaxed against the back of the chair languorously.\n19\n“Of course not, Donna. You know that with me you can say anything.”\nHer face reddening further, she stuttered something unintelligibly and then\nwas silent.\n“Pardon me, Donna, I didn’t hear what you said.”\n“Would you mind if I rested my legs on your shoulders?”\nFurther Readings for In Search Of The Miraculous\nThe Hebrew Alphabet, A Mystical Journey, Edward Hoffman, Chronical Books, San\nFrancisco, 1998\nThe Book of Letters, A Mystical Alef-bait, Lawrence Kushner, Jewish Lights\nPublishing.

The hysteric may find subjective evidence for the Holy Ghost more\naccessible and rules of behavior beside the point. The potential for double-jointed\nmultiplicity in personal styles and quick transitions between them characterize what\nis called the borderline personality. It is in these ways that temporary and\npermanent brain styles in us and important others supply much of the ground for the\npossibility of spiritual transformation and the often attendant alterations in\npersonality. How can we think about this facilitator and source of resistance to new\nspiritual practice?\nA skinny, knobby kneed, small breasted, mousy haired, bright-eyed\npsychotherapy patient of mine at UCLA’s Neuropsychiatric Institute Outpatient\nClinic was among the highest priced Santa Monica call girls serving Beverly Hills.\nAnswering my unaskable question about her thousand-dollar fee, she explained that\nshe was living proof that, in her profession, what was more important than physical\nbeauty was “griv sense.” She explained that by her middle twenties, she had\n22\ndeveloped the ability to anticipate the most highly prized but often embarrassing-tosay\nlonging for a particular sexual act without being asked. She told me that she\nhad to “empty out my personal sex manual” to feel the cravings of her clients. What\nthe john most wanted appeared suddenly in her mind in the form of a cartoon. A\nuniversity criminologist later explained that the word “griv” was probably derived\nfrom what pick pockets call grift sense, the ability to intuit who was likely to have\nenough money in their billfold to justify the risk, even if they appeared in the worn\nclothes and dated cars of old money.\nIn his 1913 Dernieres Penses, Henri Poincare′, France’s seminal theorist in\nnonlinear dynamical systems theory, described intuition as a mental faculty which\nallows us to “…immediately see the end from afar…” In the context of mathematical\nepistemology, the instantaneous images of a geometer contrast with the labored\nsequential logic of the mathematical analyst. Poincare′ claimed that inclinations\ntoward one or the other of these two cognitive styles and their associated\nmathematical tools arise from different kinds of minds. He contrasted the 19 th\nCentury German mathematicians, Weierstrass, who he said reduced his general\ntheory of functions to “…a prolongation of arithmetic…without a single (pictorial)\nfigure in any of his books…” with Riemann who called geometry to his aid in\ndescribing functions. He created “…an image that no one can forget… once he\nunderstood it.”\nExperiencing the behavior of others, we create a set of anticipations about\nwhom and how they are that align with parts of ourselves. Aware of one aspect of a\nperson, we imagine the others. With a small amount of initial information, we\nconnect the dots, fitting features we have seen and heard to personality\nconfigurations stored by informal category in our brain files. Our conclusions about\nthem “being one of those” can both facilitate and impair our perceptions. Eastern\nmetaphysicians, Western mystical religionists, socially liberal secular humanists,\nShannon information theorists and today’s students of dynamical systems in brain\nand behavior can, in different ways, make the case that the content of these\nstereotypes reflect a pattern of constraints, our personal limitations resulting from\nthe rutted roads of worldly experiences. Baba Muktananda, the Hindi Saint from the\n23\nIndian village of Ganeshpuri, called them our samsara. These limit the formlessness\nof anticipation that underlies sensibility. Our samsara reduces the uncertainty that\ncould serve as grounds for new perceptions and understanding of others. Preemptive\ndistortions reduce the bandwidth available for new information. They impair\nthe range of empathic relations with others as well as ourselves. These restrictions\nin possibilities and choices are expressed in enduring patterns of behavior, thinking\nand feeling that mental health practitioners call personality and character. When\nconfronted with these constrictions, the self justifying and diagnostically revealing\nthought about a feature of one’s personality is, “…doesn’t everybody? “ This pride in\nour shape contrasts with the teachings about emptiness of one of Baba’s favorite\nIndian holy men, Zipruanna, who sat all day, loin clothed naked in a garbage dump,\ninstructing his students and followers about knowing and being nothing.\nWe quantitate deficiencies in formlessness using statistical measures of\nentropy. They characterize the system’s behavior as a distance from the state of\nhighest entropy also known as maximal randomness. Professor Karen Selz of\nEmory University did a study in which her human subjects, after taking a battery of\npersonality inventories, were asked to remove as many dots as possible from a\ncomputer screen full of them in three minutes. They were to do so by left clicking on\neach of them with the mouse key. Two seconds after a dot was removed, it\nreappeared and became subject to removal again. As they went about the dot\nremoval task and unbeknown to the subjects, the orbit inscribed by their dot\nremoving mouse travels was recorded for later graphic representation and\nquantification. Most subjects with the usual broad mixture of personality traits\ninscribed a wide variety of orbital line styles: little wiggles, big wiggles, large and\nsmall loops, little smooth slides and big and little jumps. The counter-intuitive\ncoupling of stylistic rigidity and whole system instability (as in non-hyperbolic fixed\npoints described in the previous essay and below) is in evidence at the personality\nand graphical extremes of her subject group.\nA fastidious, rigidly organized, severely obsessive-compulsive subject\nrepeatedly removes the same dot, only occasionally moving to a neighboring one to\ndo more repetitious left key mouse clicking. Very little of the large computer screen\n24\nof possible mouse travels is occupied. All the action is centered on a small set of\npoints. When such a minimal entropy person is injured and feeling helpless, their\nstuckness can grow bizarre. Ruminative fixation in self-critical and persecutory\nideas extend into poisoned food anorexia, circular pacing, weight loss and middleof-the-night,\nworried insomnia. Suffused with sin, they ask forgiveness for soiling the\nchair by their sitting in it or smelling up the room with their body odor.\nAt the high entropic extreme, the mouse orbits of the seductively dramatic,\nnew reality-creating hysteric includes big jumps, disorganized whorls and large and\nsmall restless and short attention span scribbles that tend to fill up the entire screen.\nThe fragility of fixation at this end manifests itself in breakdown into impulsively outof-control\nand floridly dramatic displays. Their decrease in contact with reality\nprecipitates social chaos around them. The Montreal behavioral neurologist, Pierre\nFlor-Henry, using electroencephalographic and psychological test data, described\nthe difference between these two extreme forms of personality expressions as the\noverly dominant expressions of one or another of the left obsessional or right\nhysteric hemispheric emotional styles. As examples, Flor-Henry said that a left half\nbrain depression feels like hopeless and agitated indecision and the depression of\nthe right brain is an experience of emptiness like homesickness. Left-brain\nhappiness is being exactly correct and right brain joy rushes like being especially\nchosen.\nThe church going obsessional resonates with the sermon of the punitive\npriest who invokes the tension and relief of sin and salvation. The practice can\nresult in a life long addiction to the transient high of this temporary forgiveness. In\nother churches, the hysterical character gets spiritual respite in disassociative\nvisitations of the Holy Ghost and attendant signs and wonders. At Wednesday night\nhealing services, new hope arises from personal surrender in a floor hitting,\nbackward collapse called dying in the Lord. Both of these antipodal personalities\ncontrast with the more receptive state of in-between entropy (with enough entropy\navailable to form messages) which predicts more flexibility and higher potential for\nundistorted information processing. Relatively style-less and ego-less people are\nmore open to hearing a variety of Gods in themselves and others. High alertness\n25\nwithout presupposition, ecstatically aware and selfless, it is God’s gift realized, a\njoyfully awake and nonjudgmental empty state of transcendence. As we sit, we work\nat feeling this in the brain of the enigmatically smiling stone Buddha.\nThe externally inactive state of high internal activity, the Bhagavad-Gita’s\nformlessness in the world of form, inaction in the world of action, has a natural\nmathematical representation in the simultaneously expanding and contracting\nmotions of hyperbolic dynamics and its associated entropic descriptors. How can\nthis kind of formlessness equip us for almost instantaneous knowing? In a resting\nstate of uniform hyperbolicity that only looks like randomness, accurate impressions\nof others can arise quickly and from only a few data points of observation. In the\nlate 1960’s, University of California mathematician, Rufus Bowen, proved the now\nfamous shadow theorem. This says that in dynamical states of hyperbolicity, directly\nobservable on the screen in computer simulations, the first few points of the ongoing\nwild dynamical dance that appears to jump randomly from here to there on\nthe computer screen, counter-intuitively will quickly outline the entire skeleton of its\nfuture global shape, its geometry, though more time of observation is required to\nrealize this structure in full detail. The contracting motions on the stable surface of\naction, called a manifold, “iron down” all the points onto the unstable manifold that\nserves to outline the shape of the attractor of all starting points. In such a system,\nobservation of just the first few points outline the whole. Intuition, anticipatory\nknowing and that which some call prophesy, may be expressions of the hyperbolic\nbrain’s mind doing dynamical shadowing.\nTo review briefly, hyperbolic brain flow is made up of three decomposable\ncomponents: (1) The apparently predictable one along the main road of the action,\ngoing straight ahead and round and round on a throughway called the center\nmanifold—analogous perhaps to what might be a sequentially logical development;\n(2) Intersecting the center manifold transversally is a field of influence moving the\naction away from the center manifold with out-of-the-box motion, exploring side\npaths of unpredictably new, creative possibility called the unstable manifold, we\nmight think about inspired risk-taking, impulsive associations in thought; (3) Another\ntransversally intersecting field of influence, which conservatively, rationally, “irons\n26\ndown” the expansive flow back onto the road, the entire constrictive field called the\nstable manifold. This influence herds points into shadowing the main road of the\ndynamics, like the hair of the dog that stay close to the real body of the animal in\nmotion. It is in this way that just a few often slightly off the mark points nonetheless\nshadow the real (called fiduciary) orbits of the attractor, outlining its global geometry\nwith just a little information.\nThe intuitive reason shadowing works is built into these natural countervailing\ntendencies of hyperbolic dynamics, which on one hand tends to spread out nearby\ninitial points and brings disparate others together. The latter inclination is the one\nthat smoothes down the escaping points onto surfaces of actions that\nmathematicians call manifolds. However, the details of the orbital paths don’t look\nthat orderly due to the mixing of the sequence of points in hyperbolic motion. The\nmixing process on manifolds has been analogized to that of the bundled pink loops\nof the stretching (expanding) and folding (contracting) taffy puller at the carnival\ncandy stand. The process gets sequences of small particles of candy out of\nsequential order while maintaining the taffy’s overall geometrically ovoid shape.\nDisorder is local with the entropy being generated by the repeatedly shuffling of the\nline up of the original orbital sequence. This results in the impossibility of any pointto-point\nprediction for more than a few points even though the over all shape is\nmaintained. Exactly what minute a habitually late sleeper awakes can’t be\npredicted. On the other hand, the skeletal manifold of the global structure is entirely\nin evidence from almost the beginning. Late risers remain late risers even without a\nprecise, minute-to-minute, predictable schedule.\nIt is also interesting that a uniformly hyperbolic dynamical system, unlike the\nfixed-point attractors of stylistic fixation, resist perturbation-induced changes in\nglobal dynamical form. In an apparent paradox worthy of metaphysical allusion, the\ndynamically hyperbolic kind of formlessness has structural stability. The global\ngeometric predictability of this point-to-point, completely unpredictable system can\nbe both the subject and object of Zen frustration and thoughtful meditation.\nDuring weekly professorial rounds at Los Angeles’s Neuropsychiatric\nInstitute, I assigned a standard exercise for psychiatric residents on clinical rounds,\n27\nwhich involved limiting their contact with a patient to five minutes. This was followed\nby detailed discussion of everything we’d seen and heard. I’d ask them to predict\nwhat we’d find in the many pages of personal interviews and nurses observations in\nthe clinic chart. The student psychiatrists with the most street smarts, called\nemotional intelligence by Daniel Goleman, were particularly quick at shadowing and\nthus predicting the patient’s global dynamical pattern.\nDo personality patterns exist? Evidence from biometric studies of the\nhereditary aspects of personality style in animals and humans suggest that\nrelatively few global component properties underlie a variety of complicated-looking\nmanifestations of behavioral style. Primary colors are the source of all hues.\nHarvard psychologist, Jerome Hagen, has reviewed the history of this idea in his\nbook, Galen’s Prophecy. While there are differences among personality research\nprograms, almost all rating scale and questionnaire-based studies result in clusters\nof traits that reflect statistically associated properties which when taken together are\ncalled temperament. This idea is close to what we mean by personality. These\nrelatively few response clusters are given descriptive names such as introversion,\nextroversion, neuroticism, impulsivity, sociability, task persistence and tolerance of\nambiguity. As defined by psychological inventories, studies of families show that\nthese styles are heritable in the range of 60%.\nHans Eysenck, in over four decades of work and more than 5000 published\npapers from London’s Maudsley Hospital, derived common global factors of\npersonality using questionnaires. The best known was called the Eysenck\nPersonality Inventory. His studies resulted in evidence for only a few fundamental\nbehavioral axes, behavioral manifolds, which describe extremal properties of\npersonality types analogous to stable and unstable manifolds: introversionextroversion,\nshyness-sociability, low and high activity level and emotional\nconstriction versus impulsivity.\nTo make the issue of personality as dynamical system more realistically\ncomplex, we can call on some examples of the rich history of behavioral genetic\nstudies using animals such as the mouse. They can be selectively bred for\nunderlying personality factors, such as dominance, fear, aggression or exploratory\n28\ncourage. Not surprisingly, social interactions, as configured by the mouse’s own\npersonality style, contributed significantly to their behavioral patterns. As an\nexample, the C57BL strain of laboratory mouse has strong tendencies toward\nimpulsively wild behavior. To be anthropocentric and using Hagen and Eysenck-like\nbehavioral dimensions, we could describe the C57BL mouse as exhibiting high\npsychotocism, P, energetic sociability, high energy, E, and low emotionality, low\nneuroticism, N. The C57BL also loves alcohol and will dominate the low E, shy, low\nP, retiring, alcohol avoidant, high N, emotional, anxious, frequently defecating albino\nBALB strain of mouse when they are placed together for a limited time in a novel\nsituation during the daylight hours. Over a more extended time, however, the BALB\nmouse comes to dominate the C57BL, beginning with attacks in the dark and finally\nas the persistent and patient survivor over days of aggressive fighting. BALB’s low\nE, social fear eventually turns into rage and aggression. The C57BL is quick to mate\nand ejaculate but very slow to recover sexually, so that the less post-orgasmically\nrefractory BALB also wins in long term sexual competition in a cage full of fecund\nfemales. Modern social psychological approaches to human personality are\nbeginning to approach the interactions of genetic brain proclivities and collective\nsocial dynamics in this way.\nEmploying Eysenck categories of personality characteristics, similar results\nabout style as influenced by genetic selection can be seen in humans. The\ncorrelations between factor scores based on B. Loehlen’s studies using the\nCalifornia Personality Inventory in twins demonstrated as much as threefold higher\ncorrelations among identical twins for extroversion (E) and neuroticism (N) factors\ncompared with matched fraternal twins. The primacy of some of the in-born\nbiological roots of these personality styles is suggested by G. Methany’s finding of\nhigher correlations between identical as compared to fraternal twins when studied at\nthe age of two months. The similarities in personality and temperament measures\nincluded activity level, regularity, approach-withdrawal, intensity, persistence,\ndistractibility and adaptability.\nMore recent familial studies of the heritability of personality characteristics\nincluded childhood shyness, neuroticism, depressive symptoms, aggressiveness,\n29\nbehavioral inhibition and anxiety, behavioral flexibility, narcissism, deviant motor\nactivity levels, novelty seeking, harm avoidance and reward dependence. These\nstudies were conducted by R.R. Crowe, J.F. Rosenbaum, A. Methany, and J.L\nRobinson and indicated familial congruity of these characteristics among first and\nsecond degree relatives in the range of 40-50%. This level of heritability in\ngenetically unrelated family members was found to be less than 20%.\nLow entropy fixations of personality can also evolve developmentally.\nExperiments in young animals have shown that stress-induced high levels of\nadrenal hormones exaggerate the normal developmental process of trimming back\nunused neural connections, called pruning, the normally complexly over-grown\nsprouting pathways. The pruning actions of the pituitary-adrenal stress hormones\ncome to dominate sprouting actions of neural growth factors and their protection of\nneuronal axonal branching and connections during development. The research\nprogram of Bruce McEwan of Rockefeller University and others document nerve cell\nloss resulting from the neurohormonal concomitants of stress. This reduction in\nneuronal connectivity and neuronal cell content has been conjectured to contribute\nto the pathological simplification of neuronal projections and neural network\ncomplexity, reducing information processing capabilities. The still intact machinery\nunderlying the global patterns of neurological activity, such as those that underlie\npersonality styles, is arranged around these pruned, unoccupiable holes of lost\nbrain possibility. If this range of potential behavior is extremely reduced, the\nbehavioral syndrome is often called a personality disorder. Those that have one are\nthe predictable Johnny one notes of response to perturbation: thrash out, lie without\nreason, get drunk, binge on promiscuity, steal unneeded things from department\nstores, or withdraw into interpersonal isolation.\nA more abstract and quantifiable way of representing the pathological\nsimplification-induced emergence of low entropy, stereotypical personality style is\ninscribed on the head stone of the post-suicidal grave of Ludwig Boltzmann. This\nfather of modern statistical physics expressed the idea in the form of a\ntransformation: the (maximal) entropy, S, of a system is the logarithm of the\nnumber,Ω, of its available ways of being, (i.e., S = log Ω). That is, one way a\n30\nreduction in the dynamical entropy of a system can occur is by reducing the number\nof its available states. As the repertoire of ways of personal responding, log Ω, is\nreduced, so is the brain system’s entropy, S.\nReality constrained patterns of behavior, as in successfully adaptive\npersonalities, lie in some optimal in-between place between the maximal and\nminimum measures of entropy. The dynamical state that is postulated to yield inbetween-valued\nentropies is called nonuniform hyperbolicity. This is best seen when\nthe values of the experimental observations are plotted in a two dimensional phase\nspace with each point represented by two values: along the x-axis is plotted the\nvalue observed, along the y-axis is graphed the change in the value from the last\nobservation. The signatory motions of these observations plotted in phase space\nare irregularly varying in rate of expansion (near by initial values are separating in\ntime) and contraction (greatly differing initial values are coming together in time).\nValues are not fixed, rhythmically varying nor in random motion. These\nnonuniformly hyperbolic motions are seen in speeded up, talking head videos\nshowing bursts of hand gestures and in normal neuronal activity. Silences have\nwidely varying lengths and bursts of hand movements and neuronal discharges are\nirregular in duration and character. The statistical pattern of neuronal inter-burst\nintervals is not the convergent Gaussian distribution of I.Q. or heights but the\nnonconvergent, long tailed, Levy distribution of flood incidences and, according to\nMandelbrot, stock market crashes.\nThe labored logic and inscrutably compact mathematical formalisms of the\nNobel Prize winning physicist, Ilya Prigogine, and his Belgian school, explain the\nthermodynamics of these long lasting niches of restricted variation in our personal\nstyle as energy requiring dissipative structures. Compulsive nail biting, driven\npromiscuity, readiness to be suspicious are seen as a persistence of deviations\nfrom the maximum entropy of formless, flexible, receptive end states. The system is\ntrapped in possibility reduced, energy requiring, samsaric niches of what Prigogine\ncalled minimal entropy generation. We unique and oddly shaped and entropy\nleaking balloons maintain our characteristic distortions through energy-requiring,\n31\npersistent efforts at insufflation. The maintenance of neurotic defenses and\neccentric habits can be fatiguing.\n* * *\nThe children at Kids in Distress Residential and Day Care Center in\nSoutheast Florida, called KIDS, tended to be small for their ages. As a psychiatric\nconsultant to the Center, I often summarized an evaluation of both their physical\nand intellectual development as “delayed.” Looking like almost completely formed\nadult-like personalities, however, they were developmentally “advanced.” I heard in\na child analytic seminar at the Psychoanalytic Institute of Southern California that\ntraumatized children often hurry through the dangerous developmental ambiguity of\nopenness and flexibility to the predictable, fixed attitudes and behavior of adults. It\nwas common to find prematurely wise young children serving as parents in\nchaotically dysfunctional families. In residence at the Center, set free from their\npathogenic homes by social workers and family law judges, these premature\ncaregivers lost sleep worrying about who was taking up their obligations to the\nsisters and brothers left behind.\nTrauma-induced possibility pruning was often obvious in the young refugees\nat Kids in Distress. Having been soaked in alcohol containing, nutritionally deficient,\ncrack-laced amniotic fluid, young babies were then left in dirty cribs behind locked\ndoors to cry themselves into exhausted despair. Their mothers were working the\nstreets for drugs. The children that survived often demonstrate personality styles\nthat are reduced in variety. They came to use a few, individualized, and stereotyped\ntechniques for survival. Some children’s insulated detachment was hollowly\ndisguised as interpersonal caring. Others used driven and rigid compulsion to\nmaintain the appearance of conscientious good citizenship. For some children,\nparanoid thoughts were realistic expectations. .\nArriving at the Center I heard “Dr. Arnold! Dr. Arnold!” in high-pitched\nscreams. Several children ran up to me at once, demanding to be held. Some\nleaped into my arms for a hug. Trying to get and hold their visual gaze was another\n32\nmatter. Their eyes darted back and forth across my face, not stopping at my eyes,\nas though checking for danger. It felt like a strange mix of physical clinging and\ninterpersonal distantiation. Many articles in the International University Press’s\nPsychoanalytic Studies of the Child book series, described these prematurely\nformed child personality types: the paranoid scouts, the detached as if children\npretending to feel, the desperate to please obsessionals, the charismatically\nseductive hysterics and the unconscionable psychopaths.\nExperiments simulating trauma and neglect in young animals also\ndemonstrate acceleration in biobehavioral development. Possibilities, the number of\navailable states, Ω, brain entropies as S = log Ω, become casualties of traumatic\nand neglected early life. Like one trick ponies, these abused and abandoned\nchildren take up singular patterns of behavior that seem to work and stick to them.\nOne doesn’t anticipate seeing such narrowly fixated personality patterns until late\nadolescence or adulthood. They appear at ages too young to qualify for the\ncharacter pathology coding of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV. Yet the\nlabels of adult personality disorder seem inescapable when one sees a four-yearold\nchild trapped in a compulsive hand washing ritual or a panty flashing five-yearold\ngirl with a seductive gait.\nFour-year-old Alicia rubbed the lumps in my right hip pocket containing\ncaramel candies. Her blue eyes twinkled. Her long blonde hair was in bangs and\nher lips in a pout. She kept a hand on her hip and tilted her pelvis as she spoke.\nListening to children’s stories, she straddled the reader's thigh and rocked. Alicia\nhad a history of sexual abuse in a home that was a hang out for drug dealers. There\nwere rumors that she talked to strange men late at night on the phone. On\nadmission to the Center, she was found to have genital herpes. Both of her parents\nhad been in and out of prison for drug-related crimes. The Center’s staff spoke of\nAlicia’s seductive smiles, incessant demands, irritable complaints and tantrums.\nWith the back of her hand held against her forehead, she said that it was too hot to\npick up the toys she had scattered around the fenced yard. Ordered to comply,\nAlicia took three steps into Florida’s summer heat and fainted. Each morning, she\nspent the better part of an hour in front of the mirror, trying on all four of her dresses\n33\nand their scarf and belt accessories before choosing one for her appearance at the\nbreakfast table.\nFive-year-old Grace was a suspicious and dictatorial presence in the\nCenter’s kindergarten class. Articulate and righteous, she confronted children and\nstaff alike with evidence for the unfairness she found everywhere. In legalistic\ndefense of her rights and sometimes those of her peers, she used her strong wide\nface, penetrating look and quick and observant mind aggressively. Her somewhat\nintimidated childcare worker maintained Grace's cornrowed hair with care. Sensitive\nto criticism and quick to anger, she competed with her teacher for control of the\nclass. Her drug abusing young mother had escaped from her own mother’s\nauthoritarian house, leaving six-month-old Grace in the care of her commanding\ngrandmother, a matronly church elder. Recent studies by David Reiss and\nassociates at George Washington University assessed psychosocial dynamics in\ngenetically varied families. They found that genetic similarities amplified the\nexpression of individual characteristics of interpersonal relating through what might\nbe called personality resonance. Relatives often commented that Grace and her\ngrandmother, being alike, deserved one another. Shortly after her fourth birthday\nGrace was removed from her grandmother's home while the circumstances\nsurrounding the accidental scalding of the bottom half of her body in an overheated\nbath were being investigated. She began her first conversation with me, “Hey doctor\nbaldy, why are your bottom teeth so crooked?”\nDamon was darkly handsome, with teasing eyes and a gleaming smile.\nTalking to his legal guardian on the pay phone in the afternoon of his second day at\nKIDS, he was heard to be making charges of mistreatment by the staff. He asked\nhis guardian, loud enough to be heard throughout the day room, “What does it take\nto get someone fired around here?” Six years old and abandoned by his mother at\nthe age of three, Damon came to KIDS with a history of provoking administrative\nconflicts at several children’s shelters. His record showed that once he successfully\nused accusations of beatings to get a staff member fired employing charges that\nwere later shown to have been fabricated. He argued persuasively, manufacturing\nevents and quoting imaginary conversations with smooth confidence. He could\n34\nchange stories midstream without apparent loss of continuity or confidence. He\nlearned the power of a claim of abuse, and used the threat of it to control his\nenvironment. Damon talked other children out of their candy allotments, cheated at\ngames and stole clothes from other children’s lockers.\nDebbie, age eight, was the eldest of four children. Her mother was a street\nprostitute with an expensive drug habit. Debbie was thin, restless and worried. A\nself-appointed mother from the age of four, Debbie felt responsible for the care and\nfeeding of her brother and two sisters. With a history of physical and sexual abuse\nby a series of her mother’s boyfriend-pimps, Debbie spent most of her time cleaning\nand recleaning their small apartment and worrying about obtaining enough food for\nher brothers and sisters. Her mother was often gone for one or two days at a time,\nand food supplies were not dependable. On several occasions, Debbie was caught\nstealing food from all night grocers. The investigative social worker reported that\nDebbie had learned to sell oral sex to the men who loitered behind a neighborhood\nbar. She used the money to buy food. For several days after admission to the crisis\nhome, Debbie was anxious and sleepless. She worried endlessly about the welfare\nof her sisters and brother despite reassurances that they were in caring foster\nhomes. She checked on them as frequently as allowed by phone. In a playroom\ntherapy session, wielding a rubber knife, she pointed to a scar on her left forearm\nand told a story about the time that she cut herself with a kitchen knife and fed her\nblood to her infant sister when there wasn’t any food in the house. Debbie kept her\nroom very tidy, did all her chores and sometimes those of other children. Even after\nseveral months in residence, always-busy Debbie didn’t have even one close\nrelationship with any of the other children or members of the staff.\nDespite the superficial differences, there are subtle and pervasive similarities\namong the personality styles of Alicia, Grace, Damon and Debbie. Like overgrown\nand tasteless cabbages, pale and four feet across, growing from seeds over-treated\nwith gibberellin or auxin plant hormones, the inner lives of these prematurely big\nlittle people are relatively empty of stable interpersonal objects. The pantheon of\nindwelling companions are either malignant, absent or both. There is a deficiency of\ninternalized significant others with qualities we more healthy neurotics paste onto\n35\nnew faces which we then love and hate. Instead, every interpersonal arrangement\nis new, suspect and run on a cash-and-carry basis. We are made to feel like there\nare no seats for us inside of them. Even Debbie, with her history of selfless motherly\ndevotion to her “children,” felt like an empty husk, encased in the exoskeletal armor\nof compulsive correctness. With their inner life unpeopled, the best we on the\noutside can hope for is to be valuable to them as tools, like forks and chairs.\nIn new and potentially therapeutic settings, for example a genuinely loving\nfoster family, these children manipulate, testing for the feared loss and abuse that\nfirst generated their detachment. They provoke the very mistrust they fear. The\nsexually exploited child is seductive. The physically abused child provokes attack.\nPersonality constellations which can be adaptive, when narrowed and fixated,\nbecome impediments to new and reparative experience. It is in this way that\npersonality disorders are self-maintaining.\nAn irony is that these interpersonally empty and rigid patterns in personality\ntend to occur in the most constitutionally robust of the abused and neglected\nchildren. They are those who have escaped early death from failure to thrive,\nsevere neuropsychological impairment, chronic depression, severe social\nwithdrawal or the pediatric psychotic disorders. The children with sufficient flexibility\nto adapt quickly and survive often settle into empty-centered rigid caricatures of\nadult personality styles.\nOf course, well-defined and characteristic personality patterns do not require\nabandonment and abuse or the pathological simplification of traumatic deforestation\nof neuronal connectivities in order to emerge. Demanding social selection of\nparticular personality proclivities that are competitively advantageous for highly\nsought positions also results in the appearance of well-defined personality styles.\nCommon examples are the technical types, “techies,” “nerds,” whose work require\nlong hours alone to master and execute, as in doing mathematical proofs, solving\nproblems in theoretical physics, unraveling computer programming problems or\nwriting highly technical tracks. These activities can be aided by the personality\ninclinations of shyness and distantiation, the experience of discomfort in social\noccasions along with a rich private fantasy life. Diagnostically oriented mental health\n36\nprofessionals (and lonely mates) may label these interpersonally distant,\nengineering rocket science people, “high functioning” sufferers of Asperger’s autistic\nspectrum disorder. Things going on inside get most of the attention, having more\nimpelling importance than those on the outside involving other people. A recent\nstudy by Cambridge University’s Autism Research Center compares the\nempathizing (E) versus systemizing (S) ability of normal controls and adults with\nAsperger Syndrome and find the quasi-autistic adults are deficient in E and superior\nin S. They call it the E-S theory of autistic spectrum diseases. Psychotherapists of\nthese autistic spectrum personality types, patients who characteristically do not\nseek therapy but are forced into the office by marital or family conflict, speak of their\nlong, patient and mighty struggles to make intimate contact with these clients. A\nmore philosophical question involves issues of what are acceptable individual\ndifferences and why it is that these high functioning, highly paid and successful\nprofessionals have any diagnosis at all.\nIt is not surprising that the highest paid members of corporations producing\ntechnical products and services such as IBM and Oracle are those rare individuals\nin technical sales that are able to combine the skills and insights of introverted\nscientists and technicians with those of the gregariously successful salespersons. In\nbusiness schools such a blend is seen in people who combine talents in both\nmarketing and finance. In architecture this combination might take the form of a\ngraphic-design artist with computational mechanical engineering skills. Recruiters\nknow that it is difficult to find people for what is called engineering sales.\nFrom all over the United States, professional instrumental musicians that\nbegan to experience severe technical difficulties that defied their teachers as well as\nmore extended practice time came to see Chicago’s music guru, Carl Boardstadt.\nHe was a nationally known consultant to classical and jazz professionals in the\n1920’s and 30’s. His particular specialty involved those who had “hit the wall,” those\nwhose progress toward advanced musical mastery and accession into the higher\nechelons of the business had been truncated. His recommendations were often\neccentric indeed. For the wind musician with breadth control problems, it might be\nblowing uniform bubbles through a long tube held at increasing depths of a filled\n37\nbathtub or feeling the seductively diaphragmatically oscillating belly of a taxi dancer.\nPianists with speed problems worked at specially constructed up-side-down\nkeyboards with the rationale being that finger lifting was more rate limiting than\nfinger placing. He said that his most hopeless cases were those whose\npersonalities didn’t fit their choices of instrument, too often made by what position\nremained open in the high school band rather than following a personal interview.\nHe claimed that trombonists should be sensually languorous; clarinetists, nervously\nimpatient; double reed instrument players, obsessional and withdrawn; brass\nplayers, athletic and exhibitionistic.\n* * *\nAs one of the team physicians of the San Diego Chargers in the years 1971-\n1975, I spent several days a week in their summer training camps, on the team\nplane to and from games, in the locker room and on the sidelines during games. I\nwas involved particularly in player drafts. Unbeknown to candidate players and\nother teams, we used a system of what social scientists call unobtrusive measures\nof their personalities as part of their evaluations. College football players are sent\nquestionnaires each year by professional teams asking about a variety of life events\nand attitudes including their goals for the future. Filled out by hand, they served as\nrepeated measure, handwriting samples. Twenty years of them were available in\nthe Charger’s record room. Using 30 standard signs from the French graphology\nliterature and three trained raters, we evaluated the hand writing characteristics of\nplayers, National Football League wide, who obtained and retained playing, not\nreserve, positions in the League for at least three years.\nAfter studying handwriting profiles from close to a thousand established NFL\nplayers, and hundreds of hours of individual interviews of members of many teams,\nit became clear that, athletic abilities being equal, success was more likely when the\nplayer’s personality type fit his football position. What amounts to a series of\nselective filters are operated by coaches, scouts and managers throughout the\nplaying careers of these players in grammar schools, high schools, universities and,\n38\nultimately, the NFL draft. Choices obviously involved more than height, weight, time\nin the 40-yard dash and performance in motor coordination tasks. The players\nbehavior, carefully studied on the field, in multiple camera angle game films, direct\nand collateral interviews and observations under game conditions constituted a high\nlevel of selective pressure that brought with it the emergence of characteristic\npersonality types. Tens to hundreds of thousands of candidates are winnowed down\nto several hundred highly paid players in this selective process.\nDistinctive personality patterns accompany success at a particular position.\nStructure loving, politically more conservative, choreographed in detail and\nrepeatedly rehearsed, offensive players keep their lockers more organized and tidy.\nMore rebellious, resentful of structure, politically more libertarian, thematically\ninstructed but principally opportunistic, defensive players, particularly linemen and\nlinebacker’s lockers had messy lockers. Defensive team players were most often in\ntrouble with the law. Offensive lineman including centers, guards, tackles and some\ntight ends tend to be patiently enduring and tenacious, their aggression taking the\nform of stubbornness. This contrasts with the temperamental explosiveness of the\ndefensive line and linebackers. We could speak of the volubility of centers, the loyal\nand caring kindness of offensive tackles, the narcissistic exhibitionism of wide\nreceivers, the murderous rage of the defensive end, the sullen and paranoid\ndepressiveness of the defensive back, the joyfully impulsive unpredictability of\nbroken field running backs and the good citizenship egolessness of the blocking\nfullback. Some quarterbacks lead and play fearlessly in a religious state of grace,\nsome are members of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Others lead as\nfearlessly, but in the style of an unconscionably calm psychopathic bank robbing\nprofessional.\nInfluenced by our findings, the San Diego Chargers drafted the Hall of Fame\nquarterback and one time ABC Monday Night Football commentator, Dan Fouts.\nSkinny and hurt several times during his college years as a quarterback in Oregon,\nhe was passed over in the NFL draft until the third round. The scouts “knock” on him\nwas that they thought that he lacked psychological and physical toughness; the\nability to get up after a hit and to ignore the on coming tons of defensive linemen\n39\nwhile calmly and quickly surveying the routes of several potential receivers. The\npattern found in his handwriting features, however, resembled those Johnnie\nUnitas, the Hall of Fame quarterback of the Baltimore (then) Colts who, in spite of\nhis small size, famously played with great courage and physical toughness. In\nchronic and severe back pain, he played regularly until retirement in his early 40’s.\nFouts drafted in the third round with a small five-figure bonus, proved to be a great\nbargain for the Charger franchise.\nGiven the theoretically infinite number of ways that a personality can be, it is\nremarkable that the latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American\nPsychiatric Association, DMS-IV, describes only eight types, which form three\nsubsets of exaggerated expressions of stable personality styles called personality\ndisorders. All eight personality disorders can be grouped into: (1) Cluster A - Odd\nand eccentric types, whose anxiety is related to the felt threat of disintegration and\nannihilation of the self and whose style is dominated by mistrustful paranoia, a\nschizoid, detached and emotionally flat pattern or the isolated strange eccentricism\nof schizotypal characters; (2) Cluster B - Unstable and impulsive types whose\nanxiety is related to loss of the stable self and whose style is dominated by\nirresponsible antisocial behavior, chronic instability with high amplitude fluctuations\nin behavior called borderline, or patterns of excessive emotionality and dramatic\ndisplay associated with histrionic characters; and (3) Cluster C - Fearful types\nwhose anxiety is related to hypersensitivity to criticism, guilt and feelings of\ninadequacy or loss of control, and whose style is dominated by interpersonal\navoidance, clinging dependency, or rigid lock up into obsessive-compulsive efforts\nto do the right thing and avoid disapproval. This remarkably small array of\nstylistically consistent global behaviors selected from a practically infinite number of\nimaginable possibilities establishes a small set of invariants of some, perhaps\nabstract, property. These characteristic patterns inspire our search for the implied\nbrain and behavioral conservation laws that may underlie them.\n40\nFurther Readings for Doesn’t Everybody\nThe Evangelicals, David F.

My\nincreasingly impoverished fantasy life led my training psychoanalyst to suggest that\nI was running away from the critical, females issues of my psychoanalysis. He said I\nwas becoming more out of reach as I became more socially pleasant. This was\ndecades before Prozac, Paxil and other serotonin reuptake inhibitors were inducing\nsimilar hyposexual, withdrawn states of cordiality in millions of Americans. Recall\nthat Norman Geschwind, the Harvard Professor of Neurology, reported similar\nconditions of high energy sexual disinterest and abstract metaphysical\npreoccupation in patients with right temporal lobe epilepsy. For reasons other than\nthe loss of church property rights and the spread of syphilis to the clergy, it felt like I\nwas being readied for Pope Gregory VII’s Eleventh Century celibacy reforms for\nabbots and clerics of the Catholic Church.\nIt was true that my feelings of dependence on my analyst for understanding\nand approval were being reduced as I ran into less emotional involvement. I was\nbecoming a more rationally objective observer of others and myself. It wasn’t the\nfirst time that my over-ardent practice led to this warning. Baba Muktanada, my\nHindi guru, told me to reduce my daily sitting time of meditation. He said my spacey\n42\nsocial smile belied a growing disinterest in the welfare of others. I was getting\nhooked on the hard training high of not really being there for other people.\nSeveral articles in Runner’s World said that many runners become addicted\nafter even a few months of running over six miles per day. It’s true that over fifteen\nyears I missed less than 10 days of running per year. I ran in driving rain, sweltering\nheat and dangerous places. In New York’s Central Park after dark, I followed a\nfreshly strewn trail of torn woman’s garments that ended in shredded panties and a\nbra on the Park’s bridle path. In Oklahoma City at 104,° I was chased and bitten by\na terrier. In Munich at 4:30 AM, before delivering a morning lecture, the black\nuniformed police stopped me for a shakedown. In Ann Arbor, I shuffled along in two\nfeet of snow. By the Seine, at 14°, paranoid barge hounds barked in big dog\nbaritones. I ran on the Hebrew University track a block away from a loud Palestinian\nbomb left in a refrigerator near a busy street corner. Breathless at nine thousand\nfeet in Aspen, gagging on the strong manure smell of Sacramento Valley farms, in\nthe hot wetness of Houston and dry heat of Palm Springs. I wore out three to four\npairs of Nike running shoes per year. What I did not tell my training analyst was that\nthis felt like a chase after God. As in most spiritual transformations, His messages\nand music could emerge quite suddenly.\nEven after stretching, it was painful to begin and that was my daily sacrifice. I\nwas readying myself to follow the God of the Hebrews and make the “three days\njourney into the desert” as in Exodus and Paul’s recommended presentation of my\nbody “as a living sacrifice, holy and well pleasing to God.” After three miles of\nrunning, the hip pain, back stiffness and leg heaviness lifted, difficult breathing\nbecame easier. A burst of new energy appeared suddenly. The first pop usually\ntook the form of assertive feelings fueled by new personal power, an undoing of the\nlethargy and depression of a helpless sinner. New and big, I felt like I could fix\nalmost anything. Up bubbled an aggressive speech to the Dean about his refusal of\nour recent request for an increase in departmental research space. As for the\nNational Institute of Health’s recent return of one of our grant proposals, it was now\nclear that the reviewers were wrong. I would resubmit but this time ask for twice the\namount of money. I rehearsed a new list of necessary and routine laboratory chores\n43\nfor my most rebellious post-doctoral student. I would tell my teen-age son that he\nmust wait another year for his own car. I felt generally intolerant.\nIn an article in Runners World, I labeled my run’s first global brain state\ntransition, the first second wind. It energized me with the cool firmness but ready-tobe\nangry righteousness of modern religious orthodoxy: Orthodox Jews gunning\ndown Hamas terrorists as retribution for bus bombing children which was itself a\nretribution; Muslim suicide bombing as vengeance for cultural contamination;\nCatholic Bishops refusing the Eucharist to pro-choice politicians; Charismatic\nChristians gay bashing defense of the sanctity of marriage; Mohammed’s early Sufilike\npoetry of love turning into territorial aggression and Jew killing in his later years.\nOnce in while, unpredictably, past the first hour of running and after the first\nsecond wind, a fatigue easing second burst of energy followed the second stage of\nexhaustion. I called this running-induced, second global brain state transition to a\nsofter loving energy, the second second wind. Colors became intense, clouds\nbreathed and my body lightened. Running once again became easy. I was flooded\nwith empathic and generous thoughts. I understood that the Dean was faced with\ntoo many space demands to satisfy; the grant reviewers’ criticisms of the budget\nwere meant to be constructive. I recalled that strong minded, rebellious postdoctoral\nstudents often made the most creative contributions to science. I realized\nthat my son’s urgent desire for his own car was a proposal in the direction of the\nindependence that would be required of him the following year when he was going\nto be hundreds of miles away at a university. Filled with benign optimism, I felt the\ncompassionate perspective afforded those with energy but without envy, anger or\nfear. William James, in Varieties of Religious Experience, A.C. Underwood’s book,\nConversion, Christian and Non-Christian and Gobi Krishna’s The Awakening of the\nKundalini, among many others before and since, describe the sudden appearance\nof long lasting states of optimistic energy and loving empathy that can emerge after\nlong episodes of suffering, especially following periods of privation of spiritual\nmeaning and the loss of a previously strong faith. These episodes are painfully\nchronicled by St. John of the Cross in his Dark Night of the Soul.\n44\nIn the long distance running model of spiritual transformation, the first energy\nappears suddenly in the middle of painful fatigue and feels like a vigorous\nimplementation of Halachic commands or Canon Law. The second burst of energy\nemerges from readiness for resignation and ends in humane comprehension and\nempathy. In some Christian monastic practice, a similar transition is represented in\nthe ritual of Tenebrae (or Darkness). Fifteen lit, unbleached candles are\nextinguished, one by one over the night, while reading the Psalms. The practice is\nsaid to represent the desertion of Christ by his disciples, as the church grows darker\nover the night. After the singing of the Benedictus, the one remaining light is\nquenched, plunging the church into total darkness. In Myth and Ritual in\nChristianity, Alan Watts suggests that the loss of the last light of Tenebrae induces\nthe realization that “I am nothing.” This reduction in egocentrism, along with a darkpiercing\nalertness is said to facilitate an invasion by a loving God that precipitates\nthe fasting, sleep deprived and praying petitioners into long lasting ecstatic states.\nThese uses of energy and its attendant characteristics are not physically\nspecifiable but rather hermeneutic of a force. It is both a potential and a realization,\nobserved and inferred. It is the “energy stuff” of Freud’s libido, Wilhelm Reich’s\norgone energy, Pavlov’s drive, Rudolph Steiner’s etheric formative force, the\narousal and attention of brain wave and consciousness research, the Ch’I of\nChinese medicine, the Hindu divine energy of Shakti, the Hebraic ruach, the\nCabalist’s Yesod, the Sufi’s Baraka, the Christian Holy Spirit, the Yogic breath\nenergy, prana, Mesmer’s animal magnetism, Galvani’s life force, Goethe’s\nGestaltung, Madam Blavatsky’s astral light, Georg Groddeck’s it, Henri Bergson’s\nelan vitale, Schroedinger’s entropy, Abraham Maslow, Ruth Benedict and\nBuckminister Fuller’s synergy, Bertalanffy’s anamorphosis, Colin Wilson’s x factor\nand George De la Warr’s biomagnetism. Of course, by nationality, culture and field\nof study, there are many more examples, each locally defined by its particular\ncontext and haunting with its promise of universality.\nEnergy in the context of mathematical physics is intuitional, abstract and\nrelational. It is not created or destroyed, but rather transformed. Consistent with his\ndeceptively simple style of physical intuition training of the young, Feynman’s\n45\ndiscussion of thermodynamic energy and its conservation in Lectures in Physics\nbegins with the premise that it is a numerical quantity that does not change when\none or many alterations in the system occurs. His heurism for energy and its\nconservation involves the premise that Dennis the Menace has 28 indivisible blocks,\na number which his parents find constant at the end of every day of play. If one day\na count yielded 27, an investigation would reveal that a block could be found\nelsewhere, say under the rug. If at the end of the day, the count was 29, the extra\none had to come from somewhere else, perhaps Dennis’s playmate Bruce. If\nDennis locked some of his blocks in the toy box and threw some into a bathtub of\ndirty water and (1) A block weighed three ounces; (2) The box alone weighed 16\nounces; and (3) Each block raised the water level of 6 inches by one fourth of an\ninch, then this metaphoric energy relation can be expressed:\n(blocks seen) + (weight of box)-16 ounces + (height of water)-six inches = constant (28)\n3 ounces 1/4 inch\nFeynman notes that this representation of an energy relation, computed as a\nnumber of blocks, will always remain the same. If there were no blocks in sight, and\none used this energy conservation relation with blocks as units of energy, we find\nno blocks as such in the expression at all.\nThe abstract and formal idea of energy in physics first arose in\nmechanics and was generalized to electrostatics and electrodynamics. If one\nidealizes these systems, eliminating real world factors such as friction, temperature\ngradients, temperature dependence of the properties of materials, viscosity,\nhysteresis and other nonlinear behavior, then the energy conservation law says that\nin an isolated and interacting set of systems, the sum of the energies of the several\nsystems remains constant. If, on the other hand, a system interacts with its\nsurroundings, not isolated and interacting, then the increase in the energy of the\nindex system is equal to the work done on the system by its surrounds. Like pre-\nEnron bookkeeping of corporate cash flow and balancing ones personal checking\naccount, energy, like money, does not disappear; it is only changed in expression.\nAs in the context of currency equivalent value, energy can represent a very general\nquantity applicable to a wide array of specific objects and activities. The results of\n46\nthe early studies by Professor Seymore Kety of Harvard and Dr. Harold Himwich of\nthe Thudicum Laboratory in Galesberg, Illinois, using measures of whole brain\noxygen and glucose utilization as indices of energy generation and utilization by the\nbrain, surprised many of us. They indicated that energy use by the whole brain was\nrelatively constant when states of relaxed awakeness, mathematical cognition and\ndeep sleep were compared. Of course, modern studies have indicated that relative\nregional brain energy utilization is state dependent and may vary quite widely.\nMore spiritual aspects of energies and their transformations were made\nclearer during several month visits to Baba Muktananda’s, now Gurumayi\nChidvilasananda’s, Sidha Yoga Ashrams. Baba Muktananda loved and worshipped\nhis Hindu Guru, Bhagawan Nityananda. Baba had been a restlessly wandering,\nguru-hunting, young man. Nityananda said he had “wheels for feet.” After many\nyears of devoted meditation, chanting and service, sadhanna, all the while being\nprohibited from eating mangos, his favorite food, his passive, taciturn, ecstatic guru,\nNityananda, presented voluble, energetic, joyful Baba with the guru’s rather\naromatic and worn sandals. This symbolically acknowledged Baba’s successful\nabsorption of the guru’s transforming spiritual energy, shaktipat, the power of his\nenlightenment.\nAt Nityananda death, Baba, using world tours, spiritual fellowship meetings,\nsatsangs (public conversations) and spiritual training sessions called “intensives”,\norganized Ashrams in West Coast sites such as Oakland and Venice, and on the\nEast Coast, in South Fallsburg, New York, buying several old residence hotels in\nthe Borscht Belt. Baba was introduced to America by one of his first advance men,\nBe Here Now Baba Ram Das, Timothy Leary’s co-investigator in the Harvard\nStudent LSD project when his name was Richard Alpert. EST’s Werner Erhard was\nanother of Baba’s advance men.\nBaba discipled and disciplined a sister and brother who, when 18 and 11\nrespectively, were sent to live in his Ashram in Ganeshpuri India by their parents.\nThe girl was known as Malti when she served as a translator for Baba and\nGurumayi Chidvilasananda after receiving the energy of her enlightenment. The\nyounger brother was given the name of Baba’s guru, Nityananda. When Baba took\n47\na guru’s ecstatic death, Samadhi, both Gurumayi and young Nityananda became\nco-gurus. Following three years of the usual covert power struggles of succession in\norganizations, Gurumayi took over the guru lineage of Siddha Yoga. Her lively\nbrother’s worldly preoccupations with jazz drumming and confessions of promiscuity\nled to his giving up of the orange robe of the denunciate, sanyasi, for the blue robe\nof worldliness, exchanging one kind of energy for another.\nBrad Gooch who visited Gurumayi’s Ashram in Ganeshpuri, India, wrote in\nhis recent book, Godtalk, that she looks like a “synthesis of Indira Gandhi and\nBianca Jagger.” In what reads like a Hunter Thompson episode in an unwritten book\ncalled Fear and Loathing Along the Guru Trail, Godtalk’s explication of Siddha Yoga\nwas dominated by yellow journalistic rumors such as the one about Baba’s use of a\ngynecologist’s table with stirrups for non-ejaculatory Tantric practice with some\nfemale followers. This unconfirmed claim remains, as Gooch says, in the realm of\n“…he said, she said.” Gooch’s exploration almost ignores the deeper meanings of\nKashmir Shavism, Buddhism and Kundalini Yoga that compose the philosophical\nfoundations of Siddha Yoga. The importance of knowing, loving and becoming one\nwith the God within trivializes all but ungenerous or hurtful interpersonal behavior.\nEven the tougher version of the Ten Commandments in Leviticus 19 would not\nnecessarily disagree.\nWhen a Los Angeles Times reporter tried to chide Baba about being driven\nabout in his “worldly” Mercedes sedan, he explained that a very wealthy Indian\nmerchant had given it to him and “…I have to put my behind somewhere.” Similarly,\nwhy would Gooch’s account of Baba’s Tantric practice, even if true, ruin the imago\nof him in my mind unless I had already surrendered to the pantheon of good and\nevil absolutes of Judeo-Christian taboo? My knowledge of these non-materialistic\nmeanings of apparent materialism began with one of the favorite finds of Baba’s\nyouthful days of guru hunting: Zipruanna, who, wearing only a loincloth spent all\nday, every day, on a stool in the middle of a garbage dump. Remarkable changes\noccurred in people who spent time there in his presence. Baba said the identity of\nguru was established by the results experienced by those that spent time in his\npresence. It could not be defined by the physical features or ritual conduct of the\n48\ninteraction. People become spiritually energized and change in Zipruanna’s smelly,\ngarbage-filled presence. I keep a picture of him on my desk.\nGooch, in his implicitly and superficially righteous preoccupation with what he\nconsidered disenfranchising human vulnerability, recalls how the medieval church\nused the difficult to impossible vow of chastity for political control of their priesthood.\nHe seemed to have missed Baba’s lessons about the remarkably simple sounding\npractices for mobilizing the energy of the God-receptive state. Once in this new\nstate, the rest of the metaphysical work almost takes care of itself. I, like many\nothers, adopted Baba’s mantra, Om Namah Shivaya, “I worship the God within me\n(and you)” that he was given by his guru. The inner chant of this mantra brings me\nto an internal quiet in which things become clearer. Meditation, chanting and service\nto the guru was motivated by his promise that my egoistic concerns ranging from\nthe number of publications on my curriculum vitae, to the size and adroitness of my\npenis, would disappear autonomously in the Baba state of bliss. This sounds very\nmuch like the role of the transition to an “active intellect.” in Abraham Abulafia’s 13 th\nCentury Commentary on the Secrets. Arduous study of the spiritually dense writings\nof Sri Aurobindo during the days with Professor Spiegelberg at Stanford gave me a\npeak into the simple but difficult to execute idea of “simply” becoming the\ntranscendently comprehending state of existence-consciousness-bliss.\nWhereas Baba would occasionally lapse into terse Sanskrit verse and its\nmultiplicity of potential meanings, Gurumayi keeps things simple. Sitting silently and\nimmobile at satsang for hours, she radiates transformational energy, shakti, that\nmakes ruminations about human affairs seem unimportant. The work is about\ngetting the self concerned head noise of ones preoccupations sufficiently out of the\nway to allow the discovery of the God who has been waiting patiently within. A\nfellow ashramite gave me a photograph of my first audience with Gurymayi. It\nshowed me on my knees in front of her. She appears to be dismissing me with a\nbaleful, almost disdainful look as my introducer, gesturing broadly, was, unasked,\nreciting a list of my professional bona fides. The picture caught her waving me off\nwith a long, peacock-feathered stick. Obviously unimpressed, she is sending me\nback to my all night, every night, tent cleaning labors at the Ashram. Rich Indian\n49\nbusinessmen, whose large donations were a major source of support of the\nAshrams, faired little better. They seldom received a personal audience or favorable\nseating at Darshan, the evening public time of question and answers with the guru.\nIn contrast with the relatively easy public availability, mischievous play, provocative\nhumor and worldly sophistication of Baba, the ambience of Gurumayi is more\nprivate, simple, serious and subtle. It is as powerful, but in another way.\nIn response to Gurumayi’s ascension to Siddha Yoga’s singular guru, I\nimagined hearing Baba saying that God energy was at least androgynous, if the\ndimension of sexual identity was relevant at all. Baba taught that divine energy, by\nnecessity, is expressed through a wide variety of particular personalities and\ncultures and should not be confused with the details of its manifestations. This\nincluded the sexual identity of the chosen Vehicle. Guramayi’s central theme, as I\nunderstand it, concerns the simple, quiet and pervasive powers of love and faith.\nSome say Baba took the path, marga, of selfless action, karma-marga, whereas\nGurumayi took the bhakti-marga, the road of loving devotion and faith. The third\nmarga is jnana-marga, my inclination, is the road of intellectual study and\nknowledge. Aldous Huxley related the choice among these three categories of yoga\npractice, to the physical and personality types of William Sheldon’s 1954 Atlas of\nMan. Karma yoga corresponded to the mesomorphic body type and the assertive\nboldness, high energy, and interpersonal callousness of the somatotonic\npersonality. Bhakti Yoga was the characteristic choice of endomorphic body types\nwith the viscerotonic personality traits of sociability, good will, tolerance and love.\nHuxley associated Jnana Yoga with ectomorphic body type and the cerebrotonic\ncharacteristic of shyness, sensitivity and intellectuality.\nMy summers with Baba at his temporary Ashram in Venice, California and\nthe permanent American Ashram in South Fallsburg, New York, were spent in daily,\nvery early morning, chanting of the gurugita after most of the night spent taking\ndown, cleaning and putting up large tarpaulin meeting tents. I was assigned this\nsimple, arduously manual, all night work after being interviewed and found out to be\na professor and chairperson of a medical school department. Baba instructed his\nassignment committee that many if not all professorial egos would benefit from what\n50\nAndrew Carnegie famously called the dignity of real work. Spicy one dish vegetarian\nmeals, twice a day meditation and brief stolen naps consumed the rest of the day. I\nfound myself meditating for longer and longer times, chasing the promised Blue\nPearl that Baba said appeared behind the eyes near the supreme meditative end\npoint.\nBeside care with the titration of meditation-induced interpersonal\ndisconnection, detachment with love is the desired end point of most Hindu and\nBuddhist meditative practice, another set of “side effects” of the energy arising early\nin the course of too much meditation is called kriyas, spontaneous episodes of\ninvoluntary behaviors and postures of the body such as unprovoked chanting and\nwrithing and stereotyped hand positions called mudras. Baba told us one of his\nkriyas took the form of spontaneous erections that occurred during his first\nexperiences with deep meditative states. I recall a woman physician and fellow\nashramite in Los Angeles telling me that her panties often got so soaked during\nmeditation that she worried about being stuck to her cushion. Beyond these initial\nsomatic overflows of Divine Energy, shakti, emerges a vision of the Blue Pearl,\nbindu, Baba’s “gift from the Goddess Kundalini.” As he entered this stage, he said\nthat his mind filled with “joyous contentment.” Jewish mysticism of the 1300’s\nacknowledged the neighborhood relations of Eros and the Sacred.\nMore formal and scientific uses of the word, energy, like all objects of thought\nembeddable in a mathematical context, are abstract and relational. In his book,\nMathematics-The Music of Reason, Jean Dieudonne′ treats mathematical objects\nas objects of thought. Dieudonne′’s book documents the 19 th Century transition\nfrom concrete, visualizable, classical mathematics to abstract, nonvisualizable\nrelational ideas. This conceptual transition to abstract, relational thought objects that\nare no longer representable by pictures or accessible to our senses of mathematics\nand physics is yet to reach the concrete DNA-causal religionists of modern\nmolecular biology. In 20 th Century mathematics, Dieudonne′ observes that “…the\nprimary role in theory is played by the relations between mathematical objects\nconcerned rather than the nature of the objects themselves…these relations are\noften the same for objects which appear to be very different and therefore they must\n51\nbe expressed in ways which do not take these appearances into account…and can\nbe specialized at will…” DNA sequences are, as MIT molecular biologist, Eric\nLander observed, nothing more than an elementary “…list of parts…” In fact, since\nabout 1% of the nucleotides are relevant to functional genes, one might say that the\nimportant members of this list of parts are distributed very thinly among many more\napparently unimportant ones. The next frontier will certainly involve an\nunderstanding of the dynamics of the interactions among elemental parts and in\nmore abstract laws about molecular biological relations; a focus on the dynamics,\nnot the structural parts, that regulate and control their expression.\n* * *\nI made a pilgrimage to spend eighteen months within Rene’ Thom’s\npenumbra, living among mathematicians in his “ashram” in Bures sur Y’vette,\nFrance. Thom was one of the founders of the Institute des Hautes D’Etudes, IHES,\nInstitute for Advanced Scientific Studies, created to stanch the flow of high-level\nscientific talent away from France after the Second World War. It is in Bures sur\nY’vette, deep in a green forested valley, 50 or so miles South of Paris, in a building\npacked with small, thin walled, big windows-on-the-woods offices. Each office\ncontained a single hard chair, an old office desk, two walls of blackboards and a box\nof white only chalk. The use of colored chalk was felt to be without mathematical\nrigor because its use substitutes colors as dimensional descriptors for more\ndemanding abstract and formal representations. Color was cheating. Meditation in\nthis ashram was practiced by staring, pacing, scribbling, and humming, mumbling,\nbelching and farting through the Institute’s thin office walls. The building, though\nalmost completely occupied, was otherwise silent. The Institute was populated by\nsuch world-class mathematicians and theoretical physicists that once inside that\nbuilding, I felt so intimidated that I almost never spoke above a whisper. Listening to\nexcellent William Thurston’s casual use of a tiled bathroom floor to motivate a\nunique partition of a topological space, I was attacked by the awe of an early\nmorning visit to an almost empty Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris or standing in front\nof Michelangelo’s radiant marble statue of Mary and Jesus the Infant in the Vatican.\n52\nThough the environment was one of tranquil academic scholarship, I lived charged\nwith anticipated performance anxiety about the seminars on the brain as a\ndynamical system I was scheduled to present to these (I feared) ready-to-bedisdainful,\nprize-winning, pure mathematicians and theoretical physicists.\nMy dorm-style sleeping room at IHES was, in winter, painfully cold and\ndrafty; the narrow iron bed’s thin mattress contained lumps of persistently disturbing\ndreams, the small scratched table for work shim-irreparably wobbled. A faded\nposter of Van Gogh’s garden was tacked crookedly on the door facing the toilet in\nthe dank, dimly lit small bathroom. A dwelling for distracted young mathematicians.\nA retired but still famous Parisian chef cooked many course, elegant meals every\nafternoon. The food was accompanied by so many liters of unlabeled red wine and\npeer pressure to be French and socially drink it that it became a choice between\ndulled, blunted,. sleepy post-prandial afternoons or living on bread, many cheeses,\napples and Perrier water, alone in my room. I chose the latter.\nThom’s gifts to us theoretically oriented non-mathematicians were\ndiagrammatic, easy-to-visualize pictures that allow the intuitive capture of counterintuitive\ndiscontinuities in functions. How we might imagine that a smooth and\ncontinuous change in a cause of something can lead to a big, discontinuous change\nin the results. His system of topological (shape not size) diagrams was useful when\nconsidering up to four causal variables and one to two dependent variables that\ndescribed how things behaved.\nFor an important real life example, in modern clinical pharmacology, the\nsmooth dose-response curve consistent with the physician’s intuition that if a little\ndrug didn’t work, a little more may do so, should become an up and down search for\nthe dose-region for the desired effect which may involve a lower amount than a\npreviously ineffective drug dose. The therapeutic effect may occur in the middle of a\nnarrow dose range with too much or no effect occurring out of this span. In many\nphysical systems, sudden and global transitions in state, from incoherent light rays\nto coherent lasing and from laminar flow of fluids to turbulence, emerge\nunexpectedly when causal parameter are moved into what some call the critical\nregion of the values of control parameters. Outside this region, cause and result\n53\nwere behaving linearly and smoothly whereas within this region we observe global\nand dramatic changes via a forced discontinuity in what Thom called a catastrophe\nand others use related words such as bifurcation or phase transition. The transitions\nfrom painful fatigue to running rage and then to ecstatic transcendence feels like the\ngifts from two kinds of Gods, the first, bearing the righteous lawfulness of the Old\nTestament, the second bringing the empathic forgiveness of the New Testament\nJesus. Catastrophe and bifurcation theories predict and keep track of these\ntransitions using mathematically describable changes in global characteristics of the\n“motion” using technical descriptors such as eigenvalues, germs and jets.\nThom taught me my first catastrophe, called the cusp, in words during our\nlate afternoon walks along a shadowed green wooded path on the grounds of the\nInstitute des Hautes Etudes, outside of Paris. My homework consisted of trying to\nvisualize his verbal descriptions. It was not until weeks later that he drew the\ngeometric object being discussed on the blackboard. With eyes twinkling and in his\nprovocatively playful style, he said,\n“Imagine an empty rectangular box with the front edge of its roof buckled\ninto an `S’ and the back edge, an unfolded, left-to-right gradually rising simple\nsmooth curve. If one moves the causal force from low to high, from left to right along\nthe back of the box, the changing effect (represented by height) would be smooth;\nmoving from left to right in the front encounters a sudden drop off at the S shaped\nbuckling, a discontinuity in roof height indicating a discontinuity in effect. The energy\nequivalent height of the roof graphically indicates the amount of result. The roof is\nthe manifold upon which the result of causal change is portrayed. The two\ndimensional floor of the box represents a graph of the two causal parameters, the\nincreasing amount of normal factor going left to right along the `x’ dimension, the\nincreasing amount of splitting factor (taking one from the back to the front to the\nregion of the buckling) going back to front along the `y’ dimension.”\nHe gave me some examples of systems that showed cataclysmic changes in\neffect from smooth changes of normal and splitting factors. About the onset of a\nwar: “At the back of the top surface of the box, the manifold, the normal factor\nincreasing from left to right is the amount of the perceived threat. The splitting factor\n54\ndecreasing from front to back is the cost (and ability to pay) for war. Without the\nfinancial capacity to make war, threat goes from left to right smoothly at the back of\nthe box as tension gradually increases without the onset of armed conflict. When\neffective fighting capacity is cheap and/or already well funded, the country well\narmed, the increases in threat go from left to right at the front edge of the box and\nencounter the cliff of catastrophe and war is declared. Cost of, or ability to wage war\nvaries from the front to back, and serves as the splitting factor. Considering prison\nriots, social tension is the normal factor and alienation (degree of identification with\nprison authority) is the splitting factor.” Using factial expressions of dogs sketched\nby the Konrad Lorenz, Christopher Zeeman then of Warwick Mathematics Institute\nin England, considered countenances reflecting increasing rage as the normal\nfactor, the amount of fear was the splitting factor. Increasing rage at high fear\nincreased smoothly at the back of the box; at low fear, increasing rage falls off the\ncliff to an animal attack at the front of the box.” He paced as he talked, occasionally\nlooking up to see if I was following him. He continued,\n“A light above the box casts a shadow from the roof to the floor, outlining the\ngradually widening fold created by the transition from the smoothly rising back of the\nroof to its `S-shaped’ front. This triangle on the x-y causal floor is the region in which\nthe discontinuity in the result surface roof results and is called the bifurcation set. An\nincreasing amount of the causal `normal factor’ is represented from left to right\nalong the `x’ dimension, the results of which change smoothly at the back of the roof\nbut encounter a discontinuous jump up or fall down crossing the inaccessible\ncrevice in the `S’ fold at the front of the roof. Again, the triangular shadow on the\nfloor made by the fold indicates the parameter region in which discontinuous\nchanges in the result surface occur. The reason the parameter that determines the\nfront to back location of the left to right movement of the `normal factor’ is called the\n`splitting factor’ becomes obvious. Its value determines whether the results induced\nby increasing amounts of `normal factor’ will be smoothly changing or generate a\ndiscontinuous jump. The entire visualizable object is called a cusp catastrophe and\nit along with higher dimensional parameter region-inspired shapes such as the\n55\nswallowtail and butterfly buy back the smooth DE deterministic intuition lost with\ndiscontinuous changes in results.”\nHe grinned mischievously as he asked, “Can you see it?”\nThom’s catastrophes serve as accessible and powerful theoretical settings\nfor the use of energy as a generalizable, one dimensional, dependent, resulting\neffect, influenced by one or several, sometimes conflicting, independent, causal,\nvariables. For more examples: the weight of a ship (smaller to greater, left to right,\nalong the x, normal dimension) and the position of center of gravity (smaller to\ngreater, front to back, along the y splitting dimension) are causal with a jump in roofheight\nenergy from stability to capsizing, a discontinuity emerging from initially\nsmooth changes in stability. As above, gradually increasing tension (the left to right\nnormal factor) and alienation (the back to front (splitting factor) in inmates generate\na sudden increment in energy, from subtlety increasing tension in relative quiet to\nthe sudden outbreak in a riot in the prison population. Embryological notochord\nsomitogenesis, (that which become the vertebrate of the spinal column) has a\nsmooth (left to right) causal influence that Chris Zeeman named a normal factor. It\nis the smooth growth of the material wave of mesodermal (to become muscle,\nconnective tissue and bone) tissue. Zeeman called the front to back dimensional\ngradient of influence, the secondary wave of adhesiveness, the splitting factor. The\nvalue of this secondary wave co-determined a critical-valued interaction between\nthese causal parameters leading to a discontinuous change in the “energy”\nequivalent continuity of developmental growth and vertebral column segmentation.\nA little more technically: Thom’s basic mathematical contributions were in\ndifferential topology and analysis with particular emphasis on what is called\nstructural stability of surfaces representing and supporting actions called manifolds.\nFor example, in a graph of a function, say F(x), such that a change in cause x\ndetermines what happens to the result y= F(x), the stability question involves what\nhappens when one perturbs F(x) with a littleδ, i.e. δ + F(x). Do the topological\nproperties of the surface representing the potential range of actions of the system\n(such as nearness of an originally close point set, continuity and connectedness of\nthe surface, its dimensionality, its compactness as a generalization of finiteness)\n56\nremain the same after perturbation? Note that the inter-data point metric distances\nare not considered. If they do, the two dynamical objects being compared are\ntopologically equivalent. The test of this equivalence requires the mapping one set\nonto the other with, at most, smooth distortions of either or both surfaces.\nIn the context of catastrophe-related bifurcation theory, if a δ converts a\nsteady valued fixed point to an oscillating cycle on a manifold of potential actions,\nalso called a state space, then the fixed point system was not structurally stable. In\nphase space, this is seen as a change-in-causal-parameter induced transformation\nof a dot to a circle. If the one frequency circle is perturbed to a manifold of the\nsystem’s actions consisting of two independent frequencies, the circle takes the\ntopological form of the crust of a doughnut, one frequency graphed spiral winding\naround the doughnut, the other winding along the doughnut around its orifice, the\ncircle is not structurally stable. If δ distorts the frequency-amplitude relations on a\nsurface such that the manifold of possible actions is distorted from a doughnut to a\ntea cup, both topological manifolds being one holed surfaces and therefore\ntopologically equivalent, the system is structurally stable. Perturbed systems that\nmaintain the sequence of points in time in sequential order (though the distances\nbetween the points may be different), are generally structurally stable.\nThe seductive possibility, one which Thom realized so successfully, was\nthat in the language of distance-independent differential topological forms, there\nwould exist a small, finite set of shapes categorically describing the causes and\nresult parameter spaces from which, even without specific quantities, universal\nqualitative (including discontinuous) behavior could be described and sometimes\npredicted. A formal yet general categorical system within which a small set of\nuniversal discontinuous changes in global qualities could be rationalized seemed\nseductively applicable to the enlightenment transitions, spiritual transformations,\nappearing suddenly after months and years of disciplined spiritual practice. The\nPlatonic view is that the universal forms of discontinuous change existed before\nthey could be about anything specific, before the universe was born.\nIn this era of nonlinear dynamics and dynamical system, common dynamical\nscenarios give accounts of smooth changes in causes leading to discontinuous\n57\nchanges in results. The Nobel Prize winning solid-state physicist, Phillip Anderson,\nin a short but memorable piece in Science in the 1970’s said it tersely, “More is\ndifferent.” This general, qualitative mathematical theory of discontinuous change\nmodels nicely the sudden delivery of the first and second second winds from\ngradually and continuously increasing running distances as well as the abrupt\ntransmission of the guru’s “energy”, shaktipat, from smoothly increasing amounts of\nchanting, meditation, guru service and Baba love. Gradually changing forces\nleading to sudden changes in an energy-equivalent result are found in most\nrigorous form in Rene′ Thom’s singularity-bifurcation-catastrophe theory applied to\nrational mechanics and geometric optics. Here the existence of already solvable\ncomputational formalisms makes this more qualitative approach superfluous. On the\nother hand, the power of this both basic and applied mathematical orientation and\nmethod lies in its approach to the qualitative understanding of variously induced\nglobal and sudden changes in an energy-equivalent observable in biological,\npsychological, spiritual and social systems, fields of study in which little abstract and\nformal lawfulness presently exists. Oxford’s Chris Zeeman’s more accessible\napplications of Thom’s deeper, more generally ramifying, almost mystical (due to\ntheir apparent wide generality) results, include approaches to real world problems\nsuch those above as well as the sudden change in excitable membrane potential\naccompanying the generation of the heart beat and neuronal discharge;\nmechanisms of opinion change, stock market crashes and, as noted above, the\nsocial science of riots. Whereas Thom’s On Structural Stability and Morphogenesis\ncan be said to be scriptural, Zeeman’s Selected Papers, 1972-1977 constitute the\nBook of Common Prayer of this church.\nTo review and place catastrophe and bifurcation theories in the context of the\ndifferential equations of mathematical physics and biology, causal determinism\nimplied by differential equations conventionally requires continuity and smoothness\nin behavior to be credible. Our intuitions as well as the formal conditions for the\ngeneric differential equations of mathematics and physics imply that smoothly\nincreasing amounts of cause lead to smoothly increasing results and yield at least\nlocal predictability: a little more leads to a little more, a little less leads to a little less.\n58\nThis smoothness-dependent intuition of determinism breaks down in nonlinear\nequations as well as in a wide variety of the machines of experimental physics, from\nthe sudden coherent lasing of previously incoherent light to the vortices and\nturbulence in suitably bounded rotating or flowing fluid. It took me a while for these\ntopological still shots and movies of the head to become real. Nevertheless, the\nenrichment of intuition was well worth it. Of course one could smoothly increase the\nnormal factor weight of a ship until it gradually sank, but if one moved the center of\ngravity splitting factor to an eccentric position in the ship in the parameter region of\nthe bifurcation set, a sudden global capsize before weight-induced gradual sinking\nmade sense. I could see it. Indeed, increasing normal factor tension in a prison\npopulation that was identified, not alienated, from the officials and mores of the\npenal institution, would increase social symptomotology gradually. However,\nincreasing the splitting factor of social and institutional alienation results in the\ncataclysmic change of a riot with increasing tension. I could see it.\nDo we need to know the causal equations to anticipate instability and\ndiscontinuity in our lives? Zeeman making Thom’s thoughts accessible to us plain\nmortals said no. He suggested that we could use several diagnostic\nphenomenological signs to make a good guess about whether we are near or within\nthe bifurcation set. Depending upon the route that the causal variables take through\nthe shadow of the bifurcation set, we may see very large fluctuations in our\nobservable. The Dow or S&P stock indices in the neighborhood of a sudden large\nchange is often presaged, sometimes for weeks, by a marked increase in volatility,\nfluctuations between extreme values. Theorists call the statistical properties of a\ntime series of values behaving this way anomalous variance. For several months, I\ndid psychotherapy with a genuinely spiritual Catholic priest who only some Sundays\nserved the Eucharist, the corporal presence of our Lord at Communion, wearing no\ntrousers or underpants beneath his robes. A sudden change in a stock index in\nresponse to the “shock” of a terrorist attack takes much longer to settle down if a\ncataclysmically bigger change is in the neighborhood. This extension of the\nsystem’s usual relaxation time is sometimes called critical slowing. In the bifurcation\n59\nregime of a schizophrenic break down, critical slowing can be both global and literal\nas the patient freezes in catatonic postures.\nIn the neighborhood of the bifurcation set, big jumps in the stock index, up or\ndown, are possible under almost the same surrounding conditions. This stock\nanalyst-humbling phenomenon is called bimodality. Jimmy Swaggert’s Saturdays\nwere often spent watching the show at naked dance parlors and buying videos at\nthe pornography shops of Metairie Highway near Schwegmann’s Grocery outside\nNew Orleans. Sundays found him on national television engaged with infectiously\nreal, transcendent experiences in the public arena of the pulpit. The ecstatic\ncongregation was deeply moved by his eloquent and tearful sermons about sin and\nsalvation. Counter to most suspicions, this is less conscious fakery than the\ngenuinely felt alternating states intrinsic to the bimodality in neighborhoods of\nspiritually unstable, born again transitions.\nSimilarly, beginning with nearly the same initial values near the boundary of\nthe bifurcation set, very similar motions lead to dramatically different results. This\ncounter-intuitive behavior has been called divergence. At UCLA’s Neuropsychiatric\nInstitute, I interviewed a pair of lively teenage, genetically identical male twins raised\nby a loving family in Los Angeles’s Valley. One was president of his high school\nclass, a Sunday school nursery school volunteer and a Saturday soup server to the\npoor. The other twin sold pot and cocaine to support his habit. Deep and potentially\ndark mysteries live in these spiritual bifurcation sets. They leave us pondering child\nsexual abuse by deeply religious clergy and the massacre by mass suicide of a\nNew Christian congregation by James Jones. We wonder why it is that\nfundamentalists (Jewish, Christian and Muslim) have the most ecstatic and direct\nvalidating experiences of God and do the most shooting and bombing of other\npeople. In Burt Lancaster’s portrayal of bifurcation set dweller, Elmer Gantry,\ncharismatic believer and exploitative psychopath, were simultaneous and both\ncredibly real.\nAnother feature of the occupancy of this bifurcation region in control space is\nthat the values producing a sudden jump that occur passing through going one way\nalong the “normal” dimension usually jump back much further along when moving\n60\nthe other way. Theorists call this characteristic sign of bifurcation land, hysteresis. It\nis generally known that sudden healing changes of the first born again experience\ncan arrive magically fast whereas a run at it a second time, another born again state\nafter the loss of the first one, comes, if at all, with much more effort and difficulty.\nMembers of Alcoholic’s Anonymous know that getting on the AA wagon the first\ntime may be quick, joyful and easy. Getting back on this wagon after a fall is much\nmore painfully slow and demanding, analogous to the Carmalite monk; St. John’s\nlost faith engendered suffering of the Dark Night of the Soul.\nViewing the instabilities and extremes near the boundary of a bifurcation\nbrings inquiries and advice about why a rational compromise, some form of\ndisciplined moderation, would not be more desirable. It turns out that in this\nparameter regime, the in-between state is intrinsically inaccessible. The pocket in\nthe S shaped fold of the upper manifold cannot be attained, at least for very long, by\nvarying the values of the two parameters. However, if one increases the number of\ncontrols, it might be possible to stabilize a small island in a parametric sea of\ninstabilities. In an application of this strategy, Smith College and Harvard Professors\nJames Callahan and Jerome Sashin used a geometric representation of the difficult\nto stabilize region of normal weight on a double cusp manifold representing the\nbehaviors of patients with eating disorders with both anorexia nervosa and bulimia.\nThey varied five controls to stabilize a very small result area representing normal\neating by varying the control values for ability to verbalize feelings, to imagine\nsolutions, to defend against anxiety with unconscious forgetting called repression, to\nmake contact with realistic rationality and to modulate feelings with say exercise,\nmeditative practice or psychopharmaceuticals.\nMy experiences with the so-called borderline personality, with the tendency\ntoward sudden and global personality change, from Sunday school teacher to Harlot\nin the space of a breath, has been both sexually exciting and personally ruinous for\nme in my life. I could feel the instabilities in these dwellers of the bifurcation pockets\nand my heart raced at the promise of mutually unconsidered impulses, the blurring\nof orificial identities, the experiments with sexual roles and modes and the\nincipiency of collapse into regressive mud play. Most of all, I anticipated that their\n61\nscreaming orgasms, potentiated by a natural inclination to bifurcate, would be so\nmessianic as to carry me along to a transcendentally erotic new place.\nUnfortunately, paranoid rages, bursts of promiscuity and hopeless inconsistency of\ngoals and efforts dominated the remainder of our living days.\nFurther Readings for TRANSMOGRIFICATIONS OF ENERGIES\nReligions in Four Dimensions; Existential, Aesthetic, Historical, Comparative, Walter\nKaufman, Reader’s Digest Press, 1976\nReligious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America, Robert S.

These inhabitants of the near transformational neighborhoods of\nbifurcation sets, are grandly responsive receivers of emotionally significant\ninformation arising from their insides and the world. They are the canaries in the\ndeep mines of human experience. Not the usual one lively-eye, one sober-eye,\nbinocular difference of most of us, both their eyes sparkle, their feeling antennae\nawait a happening and each is regarded as new. I spot these brains in a crowd\nwithin minutes and am compulsively drawn to know them better, to become part of\nthem, to vicariously experience and serve them. They seem to have little inhibitory\ncontrol of even weak sensory information on its way to their strong, global feelings.\nNear ecstasy and excruciating pain await. They feel their anticipations with their\nbody, down to their painted toes. Their receptivity brings me lower abdominal\nwarmth in remembrance.\nAt sixteen in my Dad-purchased second hand Ford convertible, I was parked\nwith my new girl friend on Sarasota’s Lido Beach, hearing and seeing dark shadows\nof the Gulf of Mexico’s waves hit white sand against the night sky. I took her flat\nparty shoes off to message her feet. When I kissed her left foot and sucked gently\non her toes, she gasped and became faint. She told me that a strong electric shock\n64\nhad run up her back. The passionate licking and sucking of her musky, moist, pink\nlabial lips brought what she said were explosions of pink and blue lights. She had\nseveral ecstatic multicolored crises in a row, sometimes without pause. She begged\nme to stop. I was as pleased as a sexually inexperienced young man in love could\nhave possibly been.\nBowled over by what seemed to be the uniquely sensual properties of her\nbrain, I began to wonder if her sensitivity was more general when she asked me to\nkeep the windows open or top down, even in the cool of a Florida January, because\nthe exhaust smell in my car was suffocating, though I couldn’t smell it. The car had\nbeen checked and registered negative for abnormal fumes and leaks by Anderson\nFord. She asked me never to wear any kind of after-shave lotion because it choked\nher. Jazz music on the car radio had to be played quietly. On-coming headlights\ngave her headaches. Her mother, sometimes desperate, called me for help during\nher daughter’s episodes of premenstrual emotionality and early menstrual\ndiscomfort. During these times, we would drive together for hours as she explained\nthe many different colors of lower abdominal pain and how this particular kind\nyawned darkly before it cramped. It was more purple then any of the others. I tried\nto explain what I intuited but didn’t understand to her mother about the her gift of\nunfiltered information coming through her nerve endings, her ever readiness for\nsurprise and her brain’s unwillingness or inability dampen or ignore what it didn’t\nlike. She saw things in art, heard things in music that I only saw, and heard after her\ntelling. She had tearful smiles listening to Debussy’s Afternoon of a Fawn. The\nflatted fifths of Charley Parker and the laconic riffs of Miles Davis made her anxious.\nSince then and for all these many years, the same sensually susceptible\nbrains showed up in my life carrying a variety of woman’s names and I never lost\nmy fascination for them. I learned that their heightened awareness extended to the\nspiritual realm with unusually strong metaphysical inclinations and readiness for\ntranscendent experience. They seemed to live closer to the direct experience of\nGod. Attending Assembly of God and other Pentecostal midweek service, I found\nthat praying in tongues and dying in the Lord came as easily and dramatically to\nthem as their orgasmic experiences. At the same time, distant bad news could\n65\nsuddenly become immediate and loud in a litany of threatening thoughts that\nhooked and persisted through sleepless nights. They taught me to see genuinely\nthe delicate beauty of flowers and to know in my stomach that some forms of\nsadness felt hollow like homesickness. In medical school I found that that many of\nthem were the clinic patients, women and men, with unusual sensitivity to chemical\nodors, think Gulf War Syndrome, and fibromyalgia, which I heard as unusually\nsensitive awareness of normal sensory information about posture and position\ncoming in from the bones and muscles of the body but experienced as pain. This\nbackground of odorific and somatic information is usually repressed from\nconsciousness by the rest of us. Their medical histories contained detailed accounts\nabout how each of their organs was feeling at the time, sensations that the\ntextbooks say we are incapable of consciously knowing. Internists and psychiatrists\noften dismissed their accounts as signs of somatoform disorder, psychological\nconflicts expressed in the language of body feelings.\nIn the psychophysiological laboratory, I learned these brains tended not to\nhabituate. Each of a series of noises continued to elicit startle responses that could\nbe picked up in brain wave recordings or in the running record of a\npsychophysiological, lie detector, machine. In psychoanalytic training, I learned that\nthese brains remembered their dreams more richly than the rest of us and that\ntreatment with over twice a week analytic sessions was potentially dangerous. The\npsychoanalytical situation-engendered fantasies and feelings could get too strong\nand exaggerated, too real.\nProfessor Iris Bell of University of Arizona’s Alternative Medicine Research\nProgram has, studying these brains, found slower reaction times, defects in divided\nattention psychological tasks, longer latencies to the first dream, and unusual\npatterns of odor reception called cacosmia or dysosmia. Using brain wave and\ncardiac interbeat interval data as markers, Bell reports the increase in the amount of\nalpha awake brain waves and decreases in cardiac interbeat interval variation\nassociated with increasing sensitivity, rather than habituation, with repeated\nexposure to a variety of smells over time.\nIn spite of these brains usually requiring what is known as high maintenance\n66\nin relationships, I continue to be erotically spellbound, in love with them in all their\nforms. Questions about how to think about these exquisitely sensitive women, Bell’s\nSyndrome exists but is rarer in men, continue to drive aspects of my scientific\nresearch. It has been variegated quest, which began with trying to find a general\nconceptual framework that would help my understanding of this unique capacity to\nbe aware and process large amounts of internal and external information that\nescape the awareness of most of us. As one might guess, this search led to\nfundamental ideas about information and its inverse, the entropy indicating the\namount of information transport capacity, with respect to their characterization,\nquantification and measurement.\nTo get to the end from close to the beginning, we recall that it was Claude\nShannon and his followers who both mathematically proved and experimentally\nverified that a receiver must have more entropy, less already fixed knowledge and\nmore wondering, than the sending source, in order for the message to be sensitively\nand reliably received and encoded. Sensibility seems to have something to do with\nthe readiness for information transmission afforded by the brain’s high entropy,\nminimal fixed information states, in its resting dynamics. Their remarkable\nreceptivity derives from a baseline brain state like the formless emptiness of the\nbodhisattva’s “…no form, no sound, no feelings, no perceptions, no\nconsciousness…” of transcendent Tibetan Buddhism as described in the Heart\nSutra of The Dalai Lama.\nIn Chinese Medicine, xu, meaning emptiness, contrasts with shi, the word for\nfullness, both of these complementary opposites having multiple specific meanings.\nMost metaphysically relevant is the characterization of xu as the emptiness of the\ndeepest reality of being and the highest state of human spirituality. Like that aspect\nof Lao-Tsu’s ineffable Dao, The Way that is empty, xu indicates a mind devoid of\ndesire, being lucid and serene. In the context of dynamical form, xu shares the\nstructureless, non-imagery of maximal entropy systems and shi the lower dynamical\nentropy of fixations on form, desires and beliefs. Shigehisa Kuriyama’s The\nExpressiveness of the Body, elucidating historical and conceptual divergences of\nGreek and Chinese Medicine, notes that xu was the supreme end of self-cultivation\n67\nand the secret to vigor and longevity. “…to achieve fullness of life one had to abide\nin empty nothingness, xuwu.” In Lao-Tsu’s Tao-Te-Ching, “…the Way is gained by\ndaily loss, loss upon loss until…by letting go, it all gets done…”\nWilliam James, in The Principles of Psychology, tried to capture the subjective\ndynamics of the brain as an on-going preconscious stream of statistical wave\nprocesses. He envisioned autonomously increasing and decreasing coherence\nemerging spontaneously and from sensorial evoked thoughts via the confluence\nand disaggregation of statistical wave processes, “…wave crests and hollows…”\nthat achieved temporary statistical stability by “…feelings of relation, consubstantial\nwith our feelings or thoughts of the terms between which they (only temporarily)\nobtain.” In the more receptive, higher entropy brain systems, fleeting forms change\nwithout continuity, jumping from one to another with “magical rapidity,” but being not\nalready engaged, are available for use for self-organized structure evoked by new\ninformation. Without ordered, low entropy, preconceived ideational defects in the\nresting random brain field, the full attentional statistical machine is available to\nsensitively respond in self-organized, quasi-stable states of cognitive, conative and\naffective integration. They then disappear; this brain relaxes quickly, ready for new\nexperience. This contrasts with those brains that are dominated by islands of order\ncomposed of personality fixations and rigid belief systems, low entropy defects,\nwhich interfere with sensorially responsive self-organization.\n68\nAs in most systems of authoritarian premises, precise definitions and what\nappears to be strict logical continuity, as in discussions of Torah among Orthodox\nJews and Canon Law by Catholic bishops, classical equilibrium thermodynamic\nideas that are borrowed for use out of the context of their origins, risk the calumny\nof their physicist practitioners. We have probably already earned more than a little\ndistain from those quarters with our use of none-minimal or none-maximal but inbetween\nentropies. This phrase cannot be found in the literature of physics or, as\nsuch, in the writings of communication and information theory. In the modern theory\nof nonlinear motion called dynamical systems, in-between entropies can be\ngenerated by chaotic systems that are non-uniform in their rates of separation of\nnear by points and convergence of far-away points in dynamics that have been\npreviously described as nonuniformly hyperbolic.\nThe energies and their transformations that fuel and support karmic escape\nfrom the personality fixations of samsara and accession to unmanifest Divine Life\ncan occur without the loss of the richness and multiplicity of apparent reality. Big\ninternal changes without external sign can occur in the arrangements of the\nineffable and mysterious formless silence within which we have associated with\nstates of high, but not maximal, in-between entropy. For examples, the Indian Saint,\nSri Aurobindo, in the early 20 th Century, the Catholic metaphysical anthropologist,\nTeilhard de Chardin and currently American pandits (spiritual seekers with\nintellectual and academic inclinations) such as Ken Wilber, among many others\nover the millennia, direct us toward the goal of Nirvanically changeless emptiness\nwithout the properties of space or time. At the same time, we maintain an astute\nand effective yet distantiated appreciation for existential realities. The non-dual\nenlightenment of Integral Being or Yoga involves realizing emptiness through the\nworld of form. There is a way of thinking about and even computing that “nothing\nwithin” and its changes.\nAs John R. Pierce suggested in the 1981 revision of his book that made the\ntheorems of the father of communication theory, Claude Shannon, so accessible,\n“…if we want to understand information-related entropies, it is perhaps best to clear\nour minds of any (physical) ideas associated with the entropy of physics.”\n69\nNonetheless, historical comments about what the classical thermodynamic term,\nentropy, is and is not about are in order.\nWe recall that Richard Feynmann, in his well-known 1962 class notes,\nLectures on Physics, said that the subject of thermodynamics is the study of\nrelationships among the heat, energetic and organizational properties of materials,\nwithout knowing their internal structure. Historically, the relational formalisms of\nequilibrium thermodynamics emerged before our knowledge of the internal structure\nof matter. For examples, the pressure in an insulated container of gas is due to\nmolecular bombardment of the container walls, which increases with heat or\ncompression of its volume. Compression of its volume increases its temperature\nand expansion of its volume leads to cooling. Note that these relationships hold\nwithout specifying the constituents and the specifics of a particular gas or solid.\nIn his lectures, Feynman’s intuitively accessible examples of reversible\nthermodynamic properties are reminiscent of his on camera performance at the\nSenatorial hearings about the Challenger disaster. Recall that he dropped an O-ring\nin a glass of iced water demonstrating cold-induced rigidification of the rubber ring,\nwhich he postulated to be the cause of the fuel leak and resulting explosion. In his\nLectures, he said that if one holds a rubber band between ones lips as a crude\nthermometer, stretching a rubber band heats up the lips and relaxing it cools them.\nWorking the same system in reverse, and equilibrium thermodynamic systems are\nclassically reversible, we find that heating a rubber band makes it contract. These\nchanges involve complicated alterations in the internal arrangements of the\npolymeric strands of rubber, their structural properties, the details of which, for the\npurpose of global thermodynamic characterization, need not be known. The\nrelationships between physical state, energy and temperature in this material were\npredictable from thermodynamic laws even without specific knowledge of the\ncomplex internal structure and physical dynamics of rubber.\nThermodynamic theory, which makes deep conceptual connections between\nquantitatively measurable primitives such as heat, hotness and work and the\ninvisible in the form of derived ideas such as energy and entropy, yielded an\n70\nenormously rich and logically consistent intellectual framework from within which to\ncharacterize macroscopic behavior composed of unknown molecular mechanisms.\nIdeas about entropy grew out of William Thomson's (a.k.a Lord Kelvin)\nthermodynamic laws about energy conservation and its allowable transformations.\nLater Clausius decomposed the energy into that which was available for mechanical\nwork, called work-content, and that which was not, called transformation content.\nHe referred to the transformation content, a reflection of what changes in the\ninternal order properties of the system that occurred as a concomitant of changes in\nenergy and heat, as the entropy.\nRudolph Clausius added the word entropy as a thermodynamic property to\nthe conceptual armamentarium of theoretical physics in about 1865. This followed\nthe earlier work of the French engineer, Nicolas Leonard Sadi Carnot, who was\ntrying to develop a theoretical framework within which efficiencies in heatgenerating\nengines might be understood. It implicated positive, > 0, changes, d, in\nentropy, S, with changes in time, t, i.e. dS\ndt\n> 0, entropy is increasing in time, as a\nconcomitant of the inevitable mechanical inefficiencies in an energy driven system.\nThe resulting losses in the form of wasted energy show up as increases in\nmolecular motion, which could be estimated from the increases in heat. Wasted\nenergy dissipated as heat increases the amount of random motion and volume\noccupied by the surrounding molecules in physical processes involving heat,\npressure, vaporization, condensation and work; all elements of that era’s dominant\nphysical metaphor, the steam engine.\nThe highly developed, multifaceted, often quite abstract formal\ncharacteristics of the inferred property, entropy, prevent glib definitions and\ngeneralizations. In the context of Kelvin-Clausius theory, the entropy of a closed\nsystem will remain the same if it is isolated from any matter or energy exchanges\nwith the environment. If heating a system such that the change, d, in heat, Q, is\npositive, i.e. dQ > 0, it experiences a rearrangement in its microstructural motions,\nbut the temperature is left unchanged. The (inferred) entropy, S, increases (i.e., dS\n> 0) as the ratio of change in added heat, dQ, over the unchanging, absolute\n71\ntemperature, T. Thus, one definition of entropy change is dS = dQ/T. In classical\ncontexts, dS is expressed in units of heat called Joules per degree of absolute\ntemperature in units Kelvin, the temperature in Centigrade plus 273.16 o . The bestknown\nphysical image involves the heat-energy transfer to and from heat baths\ncalled reservoirs as intermediate actions of the work of the heat driven engine\nexecuting what has come to be known as the Carnot Cycle. The same formulation\nemerges in this more concrete context: the heat, Q, transfer, dQ, at a particular\nabsolute temperature, T, dQ/T, has been used to define an entropy change, dS =\ndQ/T related to some not-need-to-know-about specific alteration(s) in a system’s\ninternal physical properties.\nIf one allows some loose thinking about heat-induced increases in the\nstatistical randomness of molecular motion in the above reservoir that is associated\nwith the loss of useable energy, the positive entropy change, dS > 0, is vaguely\nrelatable to the kinds of information entropies to be discussed below. If a gas\ntrapped in an insulated, physically isolated, closed cylinder is allowed to expand\ninfinitely slowly, reversibly, called adiabatically, pushing up the piston that closed off\nits end, the gas will become cooler, energy having been expended doing the work of\nlifting the piston. Defined as an isolated system (of course no where in the real, nonlaboratory,\nworld can this condition of absent exchanges of energy or matter with\nthe environment be found), it is a reversible process, because returning the energy\nof the work by, again, infinitely slowly pushing down on the piston and compressing\nthe gas to its original volume, returns it to its former temperature-defined energy\nstate. In this historically prominent thought-toy of physics, there has been a\nreversible change in energy but no changes in the entropy, dS = 0. The gas’s heat,\ntemperature (and energy and volume) can be completely restored in this\nmetaphysically mythic classical thermodynmical tale of an entropy-conserving,\nreversible process.\nWhile fixed entropy and independence of the specific path is the case for the\nabove noted abstract reversible cycle, in the real, irreversible orbits of most physical\nand all biological systems, entropy increases, dS > 0. Walter Nernst’s 1907 heat\ntheorem yields a zero point from which to determine a difference measure in the\n72\npostulated, real physical world of ever-increasing entropy. He showed that at an\nabsolute temperature of zero, entropy is zero. We can illustrate an approach to this\nsingular state by placing a heated metal rod in ice water which would result in a\ndecrease in the entropy of the rod’s molecular motions by dQ/ T 1 < 0, the cooling\nreducing the complexity of molecular motion in the metal bar and an increase in the\nentropy of the water by dQ/T 2 > 0 indicating an increase in the amount and\ncomplexity of the surrounding water’s molecular motions. Of course the heat moves\nfrom metal rod to the water as T 1 →T 2 making dQ > 0 positive and the entropy\nchange, dS = dQ/ T 2 - dQ/ T 1 , also positive. In another simple example, producing\nfriction by rubbing a surface generates heat, dQ > 0, at a temperature T. This\ninduces a positive change in entropy, dQ/ T > 0, in the form of increasing amount\nand complexity of the patterns of molecular motion in the air surrounding the rubbed\nsurface.\nUsing another related and well-known thermodynamic thought toy, the\noriginal isolated, insulated body of gas in the cylinder is partitioned by a membrane\ninto two chambers, one containing all the gas with its temperature, pressure and\nability to do mechanical work and the other a vacuum without these properties. This\nequilibrium state is changed into another equilibrium state by suddenly removing the\nmembrane, filling both chambers with gas and, while increasing its entropy\nirreversibly, dS > 0, removes at least some of the gas’s ability to do piston raising\nwork. In the context of classical thermodynamics, it is in this way that irreversibility\ncan be defined by its associated increase in entropy. Though there has been no\nchange in total energy in this insulated closed system, an increase in entropy\nmeans a decrease of the energy available for work. The increased disorder in the\ngas is associated with the loss of ability to convert heat, thermal energy, into\nmechanical energy. Historically important and still available elementary texts by\nEnrico Fermi (1936), Mark Zemansky (1957) and Herbert Callen (1985), among\nmany others, explicate clearly the formal, but far from biologically relevant, classical\ntheory of the physical entropy of closed equilibrium thermodynamic systems.\nGrowing in part out of the formal thermodynamics of physics, statistical\nmechanics offers yet another set of intuitions about the not-necessarily-known\n73\nmolecular details associated with changes in entropy. These ideas are closer to\napplicability in problems of making measures on the behavior of biological systems.\nVery generally, in the statistical mechanical context, an increase in entropy means a\ndecrease in the order, which can be a quantitative observable reflecting a decrease\nin predictability and/or knowledge about the system. For example, we can locate the\nmolecules of the gas more accurately when they are all on one side of the\nmembrane-partitioned cylinder compared with the situation when the membrane is\nsuddenly removed. This accompanying increase in ambiguity and decrease in\nknowledge in locating a set of gas particles reflects a statistical mechanical view of\nincreases in entropy. Can anything general be said about the bounds on an\nincrease in entropy? The statistical developments of the Yale mathematical\nphysicist, Josiah Willard Gibbs (about 1875), consonant with the logical arguments\nof the Greek mathematician, Constantin Caratheodory (about 1910), conclude that\nthe entropy increase goes to the maximum allowed by the constraints imposed by\nor upon the system. A change in likelihood as a probability is a characteristic way to\nquantify the entropy change, reflecting an alteration in knowledge or its reciprocal\ncomplement, uncertainty. The system’s entropic uncertainty said more colloquially,\nand relevant to the Bell Syndrome’s women of my life, is its capacity for surprise.\nA statistical mechanical approach to the total entropy of a bounded set of\nmolecules in motion involves summing this property across all the participating\nmolecules. We let N be the number of particles involved. As a problem in Newtonian\nmechanics, each of the N particles is represented in 6N dimensional phase space.\nThat means that each point represents one of the N molecules in the three\ndimensions of location space plus three dimensions of motion space as its velocity,\nmore specifically, the product of mass times velocity called momentum. This adds\nup to 6 dimensions of measurement. This so called phase space reconstruction of\nthe molecules of a gas as individual particles are a daunting task, though fast\ncomputers and new algorithms are making computations from first principles more\ngenerally attainable. Those based on the first principles of short-range repulsion\nand long-range weak attraction among particles and the bumper-car collision\n74\ndynamics between them can now be implemented if the system of particles being\nsimulated is sufficiently small and the computer simulation is for very short times.\nTo transform the entropy into something more statistical and global, we\nreturn to the theoretical work of Ludwig Boltzmann whose formalism was used\npreviously to quantitate pathological developmental simplification. He assumed that\ngiven a set of constraints, say the closed volume, V, of a box, B, of a fixed size, V\n(B), the orbit of each particle would eventually explore all the space in the box that\nwas available to it. Boltzmann’s entropy became a constraint dependent, n-\ndimensional volume measure, with the assumption that the entropy, S, equals the\nlogarithm of this volume measure, S = ln V (B). To calculate a value for the entropy,\ncompute the volume of the molecular motion as determined by the invariant\nconstraints of the system, such as the volume, temperature, pressure and/or its total\nnumber of molecules. We may partition, discretize, the volume up to some limit of\nresolution such that it is divided into Ω small boxes, each containing the\nrepresentation of a particular state.\nMaking the same assumptions of closed system, equilibrium\nthermodynamics, such a system is completely isolated from outside sources of\nmatter and energy, it spends equal time in each of its Ω available states. In such a\ncase, the characteristic occupancy time of any state is inverse to the number of\nstates available, e.g. 1/Ω, and the system’s entropy is maximal for that set of states.\nUnder these conditions, S = k ln(Ω), where the k term is the Boltzmann constant\nthat contributes to the numeric units of entropy, as above, in Joules of heat /degrees\nKelvin of the temperature. If the system is in contact with a heat bath, but cannot\nexchange matter with its environment, it is called diathermally isolated. The\ndistribution of times spent in the available states of a classical diathermally isolated\nsystem of gas molecules can be represented by what is called a Boltzmann\ndistribution of probabilities of state occupancies, ρ (as a function of their energy\nlevel, more measurably, their responsiveness, susceptibility, to heat). Here the\ncharacteristic time of the system spent in each state varies as the particular state’s\nprobability.\n75\nLeaving the framework of physical thermodynamic entropies entirely, the\nentropy of information was introduced in the context of communication engineering\nin electrical and electronic devices. The metaphorical machine for the current age of\nentropy, analogous to the role of heat and steam engines in classical\nthermodynamics, is the computer. Energy in this context is a relatively trivial\nproperty. Ammeters and other monitors of load are unable to discriminate between\na computer actively engaged in encoding and computation or one simply\nmaintaining its dynamic memory while resting in computational readiness. This\nsituation is very analogous to the results of early work discussed previously on the\nmetabolic rates and sources of the whole brain’s energy, oxygen and glucose\nmetabolism, by National Institutes of Mental Heath’s Seymore Kety and Louis\nSokoloff and the State of Illinois Thudicum Laboratory’s Harold Himwich. Using\nwhole head arterial-venous, energy-in, energy-out, differences, they could not\ndemonstrate differences in rates of whole brain metabolism between states in which\nthe human subjects were engaged in solving mathematical problems or deeply\nsleep. In today’s brain imaging research, using a variety of physical reflections of\nthe brain’s metabolic activity, it is the differences in regional distributions of\nmetabolic activity that are relatable to subjective and behavioral states, not\ndifferences in total amount of energy expended. In graphically coded\nrepresentations of the regional metabolism of the brain in action, one or another or\nmany areas “light up” and others “grow dark” in correlation with changes in thinking,\nfeeling and action.\nThe entropy first developed by Claude Shannon was formalized for use in\n1948 in what was then called communication theory and now information theory. It\nrepresented a measure of the ambiguity and uncertainty that had the potential for\nbeing resolved by new knowledge. In this context, entropy and information were\nobviously complementary descriptors. A message that informs us about which of\nten possibilities should be chosen contains less information than one that informs us\nabout the proper choice to be made from among a thousand possibilities. The\nentropy of communication theory is a measure that is computed on uncertainty. The\ninformation reception capacity of a system is dependent upon the amount of\n76\nuncertainty in the receiver that pre-existed the receipt of the message. In the binary\ncoding scheme of digital electronic operations, the unit of information is the bit, a\nchoice made between 0 or 1 in the resolution of a two state ambiguity at each place\nof some power of two number of places. Our relatively common computers these\ndays have 32 or 64 bit processors. If these 0,1 choices are made in a random\nsequence in which each step is independent of the previous one, the sequential\nprobabilities,  � ��  � are multiplicative: e.g. the probability of getting two 1’s (heads\nin a fair coin) in a row are the product of each 0.5 probability: ρ 1 = 0.5 × ρ 2 =�0.5 =\nρ 1 ρ 2 = 0.25. Using the common base ten system of logarithms to demonstrate the\nalgebraic fact that multiplicative probabilities are logarithmically additive (and\nignoring the minus sign that comes with making logarithms of the decimal fractions\nof probability), we notice that log 10 (0.5) = 0.693147 and log 10 (0.25) = 1.386294 and\nthat 0.693147 + 0.693147 = 1.386294.\nThe dot-dash choices of Morse code machines, the go, no-go gates of\ntransistors, the open versus closed ion channel-mediated neuronal membrane\ndischarge and the left, right spins of the single electrons of today’s quantum\ncomputers lead naturally to an information encoding of multiplicative sequences as\nthe sum of logarithms in base (equal to the number of available states) two, each ρ�=\n0.5 choice called, log 2 (0.5) = 1, a bit. Shannon’s 1938 master’s thesis mapped\nGeorge Boole’s algebraic scheme for doing yes-no, either-or computation onto\ncurrent switching devices such that circuit closed was “true” and circuit open was\n“false.” Using Boole’s laws such as “Not(A and B)” always equals “(Not A) or (Not\nB)” led to schemes for circuit routing through electronic gates which also serve for\ninformation storage in gadgets ranging from cell phone directories to computer hard\ndisks.\nFollowing Claude Shannon, each logarithmically additive entropy term is\nexpressed as the sums, Σ ι � of its probability, ρ ι , times the probability’s logarithm,\nΣ ι (ρ ι �× log 2 ) (ρ ι ��in base two. A logarithm is an exponent of its relevant base such that,\nfor example, the logarithm, base two, of 2 × 2 × 2, 2 3 , = 3 and 3 bits can encode\neight binary (0,1) numbers: (000, 001, 010,011,100,101,110, and 111). Shannon\nused a hill-like, called convex, entropy function S (ρ)= -Σ(ρ ln (ρ)). The amount of\n77\ninformation required to gain knowledge of an event is dependent upon the\nprobability of its occurrence. log 2 (0.5) = 1 is the maximal entropy when modeling the\nequilibrium entropy of an independent random 0,1, (heads or tails) series of\ninformational states as might result from flipping a fair coin a large number of times.\nThis value would be maximal when the coin was fair, ρ(heads, tails) = 0.5, and the\nentropy would be 2(number of allowed states)×0.5(probability of occupying each\nstate)×log 10 (0.5) = 0.693147...or in bits, log 2 (0.5) = 1.\nMore generally, if system’s behavior is distributed equally among its possible\nstates, the Shannon entropy is maximal and equal to the logarithm of the number of\ndefined states, for example, log 2 (2) = 1. Shannon’s classical equation about\ninformation content says the amount of information, I = -ρ log 2 ρ, measured in bits.\nThe minus sign in this reciprocal relation indicates that the information content of\ndata, I, goes up as the probability of occurrence of the observed data, ρ, goes\ndown. Since soon we will be talking about brains and their various styles of\ninformation encoded content as well as its transmission, we note the other famous\nShannon theorem dealing with limits on the channel capacity, C, for information\ntransport is C = Wlog 2 (1+S/N) where W is bandwidth, the range of frequencies\navailable for information transport, S is the strength of the signal and N is the\nstrength of the noise. Recall that the log 2 (1) = 0 so only the signal-to-noise ratio,\nS/N contributes to the value of the product of the multiplication by bandwidth, W.\nTransparent clinical examples come from studies of the perceptual and cognitive\ndecline in normal geriatric patients in which the range of aural frequencies (W)\nheard without augmentation decreases with age as does the frequency range (W)\nobserved in their resting brain waves. The inattentiveness of the obsessively\nworried ruminator can be used as an example of brain channel capacity being\nreduced by the amount of on going head noise, an increase N, which, of course,\nreduces the value of S/N and therefore C.\nMeasures of the informational complexity of systems in motion, in contrast\nwith the information content of a static equilibrium state, are of dynamical entropy.\nDynamical entropy is often called H, in contrast with thermodynamic and/or\ninformational entropy, S. One can begin with a representational image of the\n78\nlocation, velocity and directional tendency of every point generated by a dynamical\nsystem by an arrow on the surface of action, the manifold, of a dynamical system.\nThis field of arrows indicating directional and strength of motional tendencies is\ncalled a vector field. A vector represents its location at the base of the arrow, its\nvelocity by the length of the arrow (called the modulus) and the direction of the\nmotion by the direction of the arrow. If we regard all moduli as equal to one, every\nvector on the surface has the same length. The resulting graphs are called direction\nfields. Looking at a stop-action photograph of any point on this surface, its\nassociated vector informs about where the system would take it over the next unit of\ntime. The whole surface can be marked by initial points, which the dynamical\nsystems move as they generate patterns of orbits of moving arrows in time. The\nfollowing two brain and behavioral experimental circumstances make this depiction\nand its relevance to dynamical entropy more concrete.\nWe review in more detail the concrete and visualizable findings from\nexperiments requiring the quantification of characteristic patterns of motion in\nanimals and man. They can be embedded into a similar surface-like setting, which\nmight be called a behavioral manifold. For examples, my students from the past,\nMartin Paulus and Mark Geyer, now Professors at the Medical School of the La\nJolla branch of the University of California studied the effects of psychotropic drugs\non the patterns made on the floor by rats of various genetic strains while they\nwandered about, in exploratory behavior in a bounded space. Monitored by a video\ncamera placed above the ceiling less cages, the patterns made by the paths taken\nby the rats over time were reconstructed as vectorial orbits on a behavioral\nmanifold. This manifold was then repeatedly partitioned, covered with, from just a\nfew large, in graded progression, to many smaller boxes, each partition composed\nof rectangular lattices of a particular size. Units of time were also partitioned into\nrange of units from larger to smaller durations of observation. Differences in the\nrat’s genetic strain as well as injections of stimulants, antidepressants or\nantipsychotic drugs resulted in characteristic and discriminable path geometries\nmapped onto the behavioral manifold as orbital patterns. Each path was encoded\nas a sequence of size-dependent numbered boxes that were entered and occupied\n79\nor left. The new information being generated by the pattern of spatial orbits took the\nform of sequences of numbers or symbols representing the sequence of labeled\nboxes. The complexity of these numeric or symbol sequences was then quantified\nin a variety of ways including the use of two fundamental measures of dynamical\nentropy.\nOne measure reflects how many new, previously unexplored boxes were\nentered by the rat per unit of time. This rate represents a percent of the possible.\nThe second measure reflects how much of the time did the rat in each box visited\nas a distribution of the probable. The rate of expansion of the possible and the\nrelative time in occupancy of these possibles, the probables, form the bases for the\ncomputation of these two kinds of entropies. For example, the work of Paulus and\nGeyer showed that the administration of a very small amount of stimulant drug,\ncompared with a salt water control, led to an increase in the first measure of the\nnumber of new, previously unexplored, boxes entered per unit time. With respect to\nthe second measure, the stimulant drug augmented exploratory activity was also\nmore uniformly distributed over the possible boxes, making for more uniform\nprobability. Administration of higher doses of stimulant drugs, at a critical dose, led\nsuddenly to more spatially and temporally restricted and stereotyped patterns of\nmotion of the rats, compulsive circling alternating with frozen sniffing. Both\ncontributed to a decrease in the possible and nonuniformity in the distribution of the\nprobabilities. In man, low doses of amphetamine tend to increase the rate and\ncreativity of thought streams and high doses generate fixed ideas and paranoid\ndelusions. In the statistical approach to nonlinear dynamical systems, timedependent\ngeneration of new possibilities is called topological entropy, H T and the\nentropy associated with the distribution of probabilities is called the metric entropy,\nH M. These kinds of entropies have also been used to quantitate characteristic\npatterns of in human behavior as well.\nWe have previously mentioned these measures as used in human\nexperiments by Karen Selz, a Research Professor of Psychiatry at Emory University\nin Atlanta. Recall that she devised a set of experiments leading to unobtrusive\nmeasures made on human subjects by asking them to remove, as many as they\n80\ncould, the dots in a lattice, one by one, from the computer screen, by clicking on\neach point with a mouse. In some experiments, after removal, the dot reappeared in\nfifty milliseconds, in the “fast return condition”, or after one-second delay in the\n“slow return condition.” Unbeknown to the subject, the path made by the motions of\ntheir mouse on the computer screen over time while removing dots were\nreconstructed as a path on a fine to coarse grained box-partitioned behavioral\nmanifold. Entropic indices of the rate of expansion of the possible, number of new\nboxes entered, reflecting H T , and the relative occupancy of the partition of the\npossible, reflecting H M , the distribution of probabilities with respect to the boxes,\ncould then be computed. For examples, Selz found that the spatial and temporal\npatterns of computer mouse motions made in this dot search and destroy task\ncorrelated highly with the subjects’ age, sex and personality types as defined by\nprofiles from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, MMPI, and the\nStructured Clinical Interview, SCI, associated with the standard Diagnostic and\nStatistical Manual, DSM IV. She found that subjects whose personalities were like\nmy high self-sensibility girlfriends demonstrated high indices of both H T and H M .\nThe actions of nonintegrable nonlinear differential equations, not solvable by\nthe usual techniques of integration, can be transformed into graphical images by\nplotting their orbits in abstract phase spaces with the three physically measurable\ncoordinates of location x (or some other temporarily fixed value), velocity y (the rate\nof change in the location or measured value) and z acceleration (the rate of change\nof the rate of change in location or value) in x, y, z space. Graphical representations\nof the system in action in phase space can serve in place of analytic solutions to the\nequations. This idea was one of Henri Poincare’s major contributions to\nmathematics and physics, and has come to be the centerpiece of the qualitative\ntheory of differential equations. The often point-to-point unpredictable but globally\nand qualitatively characteristic geometric shapes of the orbital patterns in abstract\nphase space are the objects of interest. There are visualizable representations such\nas cycles as circles and statistical measures made on these objects such as the H T\nand H M entropies and the in-betweenness (neither maximal nor minimal) of their\ndifference.\n81\nA global statistical context for these qualitative differential systems was\ninspired by the Russian mathematician, Andrei Nikolaevic Kolmogorov. In his now\nfamous foundational talk about the stability of classical mechanical systems in the\nfinal session of the 1954 International Congress of Mathematics, he gave public\nbirth to, among other ideas, what has come to be called the ergodic or statistical,\nmeasure theory of dynamical systems. Here, ergodic means the existence of an\ninvariant statistical measure on the phase space attractor of the system that can be\nobtained using a variety of equivalent methods and beginning the count at any of its\npoints. Two phase space objects generated by a dynamical system may look\ndifferent in phase space but their statistical measures may all be the same, i.e.\ninvariant. These qualitative orbits in a box-partitioned space can be visualized as\nPaulus and Geyer’s rats exploring a space and Selz’s path sequences of computer\nscreen dot quenches produced by clicking on them with a computer mouse.\nA precursor of Kolmogorov’s ergodicity was the earlier ergodicity of Ludwig\nBoltzmann. This describes a suitably partitioned system such that equivalent values\ncome from quantitating the behavior of one single orbit exploring the space of the\nlattice of boxes over very long times time as those obtained from a single aggregate\nphotograph of all orbits run from all possible starting places simultaneously. The\nergodicity of gas-like molecular randomness implicates systems being in one of only\ntwo possible equilibrium statistical states: measure zero (at most occupying a single\npoint, zero, minimal entropy) or its “complement,” full measure one (occupying all\navailable space in a state of maximal entropy). Joseph Goldstein, a well known\nteacher of meditation, giving advice recorded in Daniel Goleman’s 1977 book on the\nsubject said that all methods of nirvana directed meditation amounted to “…simple\nmathematics …all systems aiming for One or Zero—union with God or emptiness.”\nIn place of the maximal or minimal values for the H T and H M entropies of these\nstates of transcendence, we in the world of samsara are stuck in states of inbetween\nentropy which invariant statistical measures of on phase space shapes\nhelp quantify.\nTo generalize measures made on rat and computer mouse paths to more\ngeneral and idealized systems, after plotting an orbital path in a phase space, we\n82\nmay partition the space of values taken by the journey of the orbital action\ngenerated by the equation over time with rectangular grids of increasing fineness.\nThe result is an equipartition of phase space such that there is at most one orbital\npoint in each rectangle of the grid, with, of course, many rectangles in the finer grids\nbeing empty. This final grid partition is called a generating partition. The proportion\nof the available boxes of the partition occupied by points is called its area or volume\nmeasure. This measure has been given a variety of names including Liouville, Haar\nand Lesbegue measures. If every box is occupied, it has measure one. If at most\none box, it has measure zero. If we allow partitions to be non-uniform and/or not\nfine enough to be generating and apply probability weightings for how many points\nfall into each particular box of the grid, the method is called the Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen\nor SRB measure after Kolmogorov’s students and followers, the Russian, Ya Sinai,\nthe Belgian Frenchmen, David Ruelle and the American, Rufus Bowen.\nSimilar to the SRB measure, the distribution of box occupancy probabilities\nmultiplied by their logarithms and summed over all cells of the partition yields a\nstatistical measure that is close to the informational entropy of Claude Shannon as\ndescribed above. It is called the metric entropy ( H M = -Σ(ρ i ln(ρ i )), where H means\nentropy and ρ i is the proportion of the total observations that occupy cell i of the\nphase space or state space partition. It was the above noted Russian father of\nmodern dynamical systems, Kolmogorov, who in 1956 proved that the Shannon\nmetric entropy is a quantifiable invariant of systems even in very complicated\nmotion. Stanford University's Donald Ornstein won a Field’s Medal (the under forty\nyear old mathematician’s Nobel Prize) for his late 1960’s work proving that the\nShannon metric entropy, H M , was the only invariant for a large class of appropriately\ndefined, expansive (near by points separating in time) dynamical systems. Recall\nthat we refer to metric entropy reflecting the relative occupancy as probability\namong the possible boxes (or states) as H M . H M is maximal when the percentage\noccupancy of all occupied boxes is uniform.\nIBM’s Roy Adler in New York and Brian Marcus in California, Hebrew\nUniversity’s Benjamin Weiss, Warwick University’s English mathematicians, William\nParry, Peter Walters, Mark Pollicott and others developed and proved the relevance\n83\nof a related measure of the rapidity of dynamical expansion, the generation of new\ninformation seen as the rate of entering new boxes of the partition, a logarithmic\nrate of expansion of the possible. Counting the number of previously unoccupied\nsquares entered by the dynamical systems orbit per unit time over the generating\npartition, for instance, yields an estimate of entropy that, as in the rat and computer\nmouse examples above, is called the topological entropy, H T . H T , is about how\nmuch new information is being generated by the system per unit time. Theorems\nhave been proven that H T is a maximal estimate of the global dynamical entropy\nwith H M proven to be a minimum estimate. Monitoring single or aggregate molecular\nmotion in a system with the maximum randomness of a space filling gas, we find\nthat, on the average, every box is entered and occupied uniformly such that H T = H M\nor said another way, H T – H M = 0.\nAs evidenced by the above described experiments in rats and people, the\nsame entropic relations (but usually not with maximal or minimal measure) can be\nfound in biological systems. We have previously described the manifold geometry of\na generic (typical, idealized) nonlinear dynamical systems as hyperbolic defined by\nthe presence of simultaneous but decomposable components of the motion\nincluding the straight ahead and round and round actions on the center manifold,\nthe new possibility generating, expansive, away from the center manifold motions\nalong unstable manifolds and the back to the center manifold, contracting motions,\nalong the stable manifolds. Uniform expansive and contractive influences in the flow\nleads to mixing of the order of the initial sequence of the values inscribed by the\norbits. This results in maximization of the entropies and satisfaction of a\nconcomitant of the uniformly hyperbolic condition, H T – H M = 0.\nThese clean and mathematically proven findings do not hold for the quasimess\nthat is human neuropsychobiology. Enmeshed as most of us are in only\nintermittently random or nonuniformly hyperbolic systems with the in-between\nentropies of the only apparently real world of maya, H T – H M ≠ 0. How the H T – H M\n= 0 of uniform hyperbolicity fails, H T – H M ≠ 0, and along with it the dispassionate\ndetachment of entropic emptiness and fullness, becomes a problem not unrelated to\nthe existence and quantitative qualities of personality styles and their dissolution\n84\nwith return toward but not reaching the maximally entropic openness, flexibility and\nnaïve credulousness of the in Jesus and Holy Ghost occupying transcendent\ndynamical states. We are all stuck somewhere in the range of measures indicating\nin-between entropies.\nFurther Readings for Sensual In-Between Entropies\nEcstasy in Secular and Religious Experience, Marghanita Laski, Tarcher, Los\nAngeles, 1961.\nThe Role of Neural Plasticity in Chemical Intolerance, Barbara A.

After\nstruggling for several months to identify an apparently new compound, which turned\nout not to be new but only new in the brain, we collected evidence for a human\nbrain enzyme that could catalyze the production of an LSD-like hallucinogen,\ndimethyltryptamine, DMT. Tracing its metabolic origins, we found that DMT was\nderived from tryptamine, a common metabolite of the essential and omnipresent\namino acid, tryptophan. This enzyme and its metabolic product were located in\nhighest concentrations in brain stem systems that influence the neural regulation of\nthe heart, blood pressure, temperature, breathing, vomiting and primitive approachavoidance\nbehavior. It was also found in limbic brain nuclei thought to modulate the\nemotional coloring of perception and thought. Richard Wyatt, working at the\nNational Institutes of Mental Health found DMT in the urine of schizophrenic\nhumans. He also showed that DMT increased significantly if tryptamine’s normal\npathway for degradation was blocked by monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as\n87\nNardil, Marplan, Eutony, Parnate and others of a then common family of\nantidepressant drugs.\nThe presence of a DMT-generating enzyme in human brain was particularly\nexciting because we knew from the work of Harvard botanist, Richard Shultes and\nothers, that DMT and the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, beta carboline, are\ncombined in a mixture of the leaves of a shrub and the bark of a vine, both\nAmazonian plants, used together by the shaman of Peru, Colombia and Ecuador for\nthousands of years to evoke mystical experiences in themselves. In their state of\nchemically-facilitated, spiritual transformation, they were better able to engage in\nhealing and divination of others. More recently this and other similarly acting\nbiochemicals have been called entheogenic, “connecting to the sacred within.”\nConsistent with our neurochemical findings in human brain, the shamanic\nconcoction, called by many names including ayahuasca and yage, combined the\nDMT containing plant, Psychotria viridis, with an extract of a vine with the powerful\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitor properties of the beta carbolines found in\nBanisteriospsis caapi. In 1975, working with a graduate student, Louise Hsu, we\nfound that the mammalian brain could also synthesize beta carbolines. This family\nof compounds from the vine protects the tryptamine substrate as well as DMT from\nmetabolic degradation such that it could circulate in the blood long enough after oral\ningestion for enough to cross the blood brain barrier to induced prolonged and\ndramatic alterations in perceptions, feelings and thoughts. In addition, the\ncarbolines of the Benisteriospsis component extended the time of action of DMT\nbeyond the 15-30 minutes of effect of DMT when injected alone in human subjects.\nWe found it fascinating that the human brain made combinations of DMT and beta\ncarbolines similar to the blend that indigenous shamamic chemists discovered as an\nentheogenic from plant sources.\nRalph Metzner, in the introduction to his 1999 collection of papers called\nAyahuasca concluded that “…it is widely recognized by anthropologists as\nbeing…the most powerful and most widespread of the shamanic hallucinogens.”\nWilliam Burrough in a 1953 City Lights published book written with Allen Ginsberg,\nThe Yage Letters, said that yage “…gave entrance to a city where all human\n88\npotential is spread out in a silent market…” It was generally believed that with\nadequate spiritual preparation, ayahuasca could generate transcendent states that\nallowed access to ones inner being and the beings of other worlds that could serve\nas sources of mystical knowledge and healing. The Shams dervish of the 13 th\nCentury, wandering the Turkish portion of the Silk Road, used the word sohbet to\ndescribe the inner land of mystical conversations about mystical subjects that their\nturning meditation, whirling, and the shaman’s entheogenic compounds such as\nDMT give entrance.\nThe question was whether our finding of DMT and its human brain enzyme\nhad been an artifact, an accidental laboratory fluke. Members of my neurochemical\nresearch teams at the University of California Medical Schools in Irvine and La\nJolla, notably Dr. Lee Poth, now a professor of pediatric endocrinology at the\nUniform Services Medical School in Washington D.C., demonstrated that the DMT\nsynthesizing enzyme existed in the brains of recent accident victims that as far as\nwe were able to learn from their family and social histories, had been completely\npsychologically normal. More than a little bit startled by this finding and worried\nabout making a sensational scientific mistake, we repeated the experiments with a\nvariety of controls with the same findings. Though our original estimates of the\nhuman brain enzyme concentration were on the high side, we confirmed the general\nfinding and published them in Science in 1969 and Nature in 1970. Our carboline\nwork was published in the Journal of Neurochemistry in 1975. A year or so after our\nNature paper was published, the Nobel Prize winning neuropharmacologist at the\nNational Institutes of Mental Health, Julius Axelrod, confirmed the presence of the\nDMT biosynthetic enzyme that converted the tryptophan product, tryptamine, to\nDMT in mammalian brain tissue. We were both delighted and relieved.\nWe speculate, perhaps too grandly, that this finding, along with the beta\ncarboline human brain synthesizing capacity, supplies one of many possible\nneurobiological and neurochemical mechanisms for the claims of the cross-cultural\nuniversality of mystical experience. We all had human brains with these enzymes.\nThe idea that the phenomena accompanying primary religious experience were\ncommon to all cultures was a major theme of the life’s work of the philosopher-\n89\npsychologist, William James, and was studied using fieldwork by anthropologists\nsuch as Bronislaw Malinolowki as described in his classic book, Magic, Science and\nReligion. Was this neurochemical-behavioral organization an evolutionarily adaptive\nmechanism selected so that some spiritually gifted individuals self-selected from a\nseverely stressed population could escape and then lead the rest of us out of a\nsense world that had become intolerable? Could this be an antidote for the\nhopeless, without materialistic solutions and trapped in a belief system of spiritual\nnihilism? Was this a brain chemical transcendence escape and spiritual delivery\nsystem for the suprapsychological survival of those in dire need? As the 13 th\nCentury Islamic mystic, Jelaluddin Rumi, has written, “If a tree could fly off, it\nwouldn’t suffer the saw…” and more concretely, “…if you can’t go somewhere,\nmove into the passageways of the self…,” a spiritual escape via a neurobiological\nroad to the God-space within.\nWhat followed were a few years of occasional exploration of an “inside out”\nunderstanding of the mystical states evoked by the entheogenic family of chemicals.\nThere were varieties of settings for these personal experiments. I found myself\nLSD-lost, circling endlessly in the tall silence of a Northern California redwood\nforest. I tried on Hunter Thompson’s mescaline lenses for the experience of Las\nVegas unfiltered. I was expertly mentored in these quests by a distinguished\ncollection of guides: Cultural anthropologist Michael Harner who taught me about\nthe yage and datura use among the shaman of the Jivaro; Social anthropologist,\nBarbara Meyerhoff introduced me to the personal renewal rituals of the peyote\ncactus-using Huichol Indians of the Southwestern Sonora Desert; Neurochemically\nsophisticated Sidney Cohen, founding director of the National Institutes of Health’s\nInstitute on Drug Abuse, told me stories of his involvement with Aldous Huxley and\nBarbara Brown in the Los Angeles covey of early American LSD explorers; organic\nchemist Albert Hoffman, Sandoz’s designer of a series of ergot alkaloids including\nLSD, told me stories of his accidental post-sniff hallucinations while returning home\non a bicycle; An anonymous group of us conducted personal experiments with\nSacha Shulgin, the University of California at Berkeley professor who first\nsynthesized and tested the mescaline-derived, Ecstasy series of compounds; We\n90\ndid some work with the dissociated anesthesias (producing wide awake but not\nthere states) having consulted with John Lilly, a brain scientist who used these\nagents as a courageous self-medicating explorer of sensory isolation tanks; I met\nseveral native shamanic practitioners including the Huichol Indian that was the\nmodel for Don Juan in Carlos Castanada’s five volumes of pseudoethnography\nwritten up in my essay “Is Don Juan Alive and Well?” in The Pushcart Prize of 1977.\nIssues of culture and brain chemistry came together in several accounts about\nentheogenic, mescaline-containing peyote use among the Huichol Indians in a book\nedited by Kathleen Berrin and Thomas Seligman of the San Francisco Art Museum\ncalled Art of the Huichol Indians.\nOver these years I collected many nauseating, upper and lower bowel\nwrenching and ecstatically transcendent and exhausting day-long episodes of the\nangular geometries of visual pattern-generating DMT, the animistic breathing of\nbush and flower breathing peyote cactus, the darkly forbidding shadows of the\npsylocybin-containing mushrooms, the irreversible rocket launches into the\nelectrically buzzing, kaleidoscopic circus of LSD-containing vials from Sandoz and\nthe optimistic, trust engendering, expansively warm rush of six of Sacha Shulgin’s\ngregarious, rave dancing, chlorinated, methoxylated and ethoxylated\nphenylethylamines which he had, years before, synthesized for “an undisclosed\npurpose” for the Dow Chemical Corporation under contract with the U.S. Army\nChemical Corps. The best known of the latter group remains part of the rave culture\nas Ecstasy.\nThese agent’s peaks are flooded with exaggerated, caricaturizing images of\npeople’s faces and a belief in the mindedness of animals and even the embodiment\nof inanimate things. Evoked are simultaneous and diametrically conflicting\ninterpretations of the same social context, heteromodal sensory fusion called\nsynesthesia so that sound bespoke color and smells induced music, habitual\nthoughts rearranged as new ideas in what is experienced as exciting new insights,\nand, most of all, that which Louis Lewin, Berlin’s early 20 th Century Freud of\npsychotropic drugs in his book Fantastica, called gladness of the soul. Timothy\nLeary wrote of entheogenic escape from the habitual human brain’s mental-\n91\nmanipulative and socio-sexual circuits gaining access to the rapture and ecstasy\nbrain pathways on the way to the new planet within.\nWhat is seldom written about is the aftermath of chemical entheogenic\nagents. After the several hours of fireworks, all of these entheogenic agents, some\nmore than others, gifted me with weeks to months of more self-sufficient, emotional\nfullness and ease in the conduct of living that was less contaminated by narcissistic\npreoccupation or defensive distantiation. I was left with increased interpersonal\nsensitivity and a noticeable repair of my deficiencies in aesthetic sensibility,\nparticularly for the visual arts and landscapes. What were once two dimensional,\ntrivial, beside-the-point, scattered copses of trees and apparently casual arrays of\nplant life in the Boboli Gardens behind the Palazzo Pitti in Florence, became the\ngrandly structured, botanical wonder of increased dimension, communicating awe\nfilled new perceptions of its previously unseen beauty. For the first time, I found\nmyself walking slowly and stopping for several minutes, wordless, spellbound, in\nfront of the modern art pieces of New York’s Guggenheim Museum. Lost in the\nexperience, I found myself exclaiming to no one in particular, “I can see!”\nThe delicacy and deliciousness of post-entheogenic agent’s new and\nbeautiful everything made me tiptoe watchfully so as not to injure an ant. Feelings of\nomnipersonal kindness and generous compassion were without prideful selfreflection.\nThis state of grace felt like an invasion of a shimmering presence that\nmade contact with my other, generally unknown to me, life. It brought new\nperceptions, feelings and ideas for which I was moved to give thanks. I began to\nthink I understood a little bit about what was meant by living in the Spirit and\nmerging with God. Mircea Eliade, the French, University of Chicago Professor of the\nHistory of Religions, in his classic The Sacred and Profane, calls the revelation of\nthe sacred in ordinary objects, people and events an hierophany. In the state that\nthis requires, “…all nature is capable of revealing itself as cosmic sacrality….” The\nentire world can become a hierophany with what Abraham Abulafia called an\nactivated mind, the Jewish soul of emergent properties called the Nefesh.\nThis entirely new world, Rudolf Otto in his 1917 Das Helige (The Sacred)\ncalled it ganz andere, (wholly other, something else), seemed to emerge\n92\nspontaneously along with an instantaneous knowing-how-it-is-with-you-and-I-andall-of-us\nthat made even vicious killers appear sympathetic. Is this what the\nCharismatic New Testament Book Churches mean by redemption through\nforgiveness of others, requiring the genuine sincerity of this thought before\nqualifying for Communion? Is this Christ’s undemanding gift of grace as in Romans\n4: where Paul observed that all of us fall short of the full glory of God unless justified\nfreely by His grace. Was this the New Testament’s spiritual technological advance\nfrom the Old Testament’s and Koran’s eye-for-an-eye? Did this chemically triggered\ntranscendent experience differ significantly from the supernatural transformation of\nindividuals by the Holy Spirit of Christian revivalist teachings? Martin Marty,\nUniversity of Chicago’s Professor of Modern Church History, dates the\ninstitutionalization of this personal transformation in the United States to the post-\nCivil War period. Did this mean that the mysteriously selfless love of Christian\nagape and the altruism of E.O. Wilson’s sociobiology lay waiting in the brain and\ncould appear spontaneously, by grace, without lawful directive, repetitive recitation\nor the discipline of catechism?\nAs one might have suspected, the urgency of my inner and outer search for a\nnew spiritual ecology of mind was driven by more personal needs. My spiritual\nhunger was made acute a couple of years before our laboratory’s DMT discovery\nwhen as a 30 year old Assistant Professor of Psychiatry and Neuroscience at UCLA\nin West Los Angeles, I was living in a small, heavily mortgaged house in Brentwood\nwith my graduate student wife and two young sons. A testicular lump was an\naccidental discovery made while showering. After surgical biopsy and radical lymph\nnode dissection, the professor of urology gave me a diagnosis of right testicular\nchoriocarcinoma. All by itself, my testicle had given birth to a mass containing all the\nembryological tissues of a fetus, and had thrown in some maternal placental cells\nas lagniappe. Unlike now, when the group of testicular neoplasms are treated\nsuccessfully with a high survival rate (think Lance Armstrong), at that time, follow up\nresearch of this young man’s disease by the Army Medical Corps promised a fiveyear\nsurvival rate of only 5% to 10%. The news filled me with fear and the ensuing\nhopeless resignation detached me from life with a dread broken up only by\n93\nepisodes of rageful envy of everyone else in the world that had been spared. My\nwife escaped into an alcoholic flirtation with her major professor; my sons grew\nincreasingly ensconced in the generous and kind neighborhood homes of their\nplaymates. I metered as many hours as possible in equity growing, long lonely days\nin a small, dark, couch filled, university office, listening to Beverly Hills, Brentwood\nand West Los Angles citizens as they psychoanalyzed their mysterious lack of\nemotional fulfillment from materialistic fulfillment. Legend has it that Gautama’s\nsudden insight about the universality of this sated, bored condition occurred in 528\nB.C. after 49 days of sitting in the lotus position under the bodhi tree, now called\nficus religiosa. In contrast with Buddha’s illumination, my psychoanalytic traininginduced,\nFreudian-Darwinian instinctual conflict, driven by fears of starvation and\ncastration, drew me tighter into the world of meaningless, coin flip probabilities.\nOur house was a block away from a West Los Angeles synagogue and we\nknew the Rabbi and his family well. Our sons played together frequently. The Rabbi\ntried to bring comfort to me on my death watch, with hours of discussions about\ntrans-individual, ethnic belonging and a deeper foray into philosophical humanism.\nBoth felt completely irrelevant to my condition. As an intern tending to those dying at\nnight in Ochsner Foundation Hospital in New Orleans, it seemed to me that Jews\ntended to die more noisily than Catholics. For my personal escape from low-lying\ndread, I needed the metrically linear time of chronos to become the metric-free,\ntopological, continuous surface of the twisted circular ribbon of a Mobius loop, with\nthe view from each moment a kairos, a stretchable infinity of each moment’s internal\nmultiplicity of times.\nThe ruthlessly reasonable Hebraic historicity, configured by the tooth-for-atooth,\nMosaic and Roman talion law, the reciprocal, economic, exchange-calculating\nbrains of Barkow, Cosmide and Tooby’s The Adapted Mind (1992) and the terrifying\nstories of the Five Books of Moses, made the hopelessness of this sinner’s plight\ninevitable. It felt like my dichotomous choice of God-type was between One of\nmerciless fairness and the He and She of unconditionally forgiving generosity. The\nmind set of logical problem solving applied to the question about which of these two\nrepresented the true character of God lead to a momentarily distracting, metaphoric\n94\necclesial exercise: what were the minimal number of four magical cards need we\nturn over with preconditions or results on the upsides and downsides if what was\nshowing was: (1) Beatifically good; (2) Cursed with extraordinarily bad luck; (3) Not\ndependent upon personal virtue; (4) Inordinately fortunate in all of life’s trials. The\npay-as-you-go God people would need to pick up (1) and find fortunate life and (2)\nto find the fate of the non-believer to establish that God was coldheartedly true and\nfair with the results of flipping (3) and (4) being none contributory. The grace-to-allsinners\nGod people need to turn over card (3) to find good life and (4) to find\nsometime sinners nonetheless fortunate to confirm their belief in the unconditionally\nof the loving generosity of God and making finding out about the underside of cards\n(1) and (2) unnecessary. This liturgical discussion and gamble with God’s cards,\nperhaps a caricature of the Talmudic, rational discussions with the rabbi, felt\nirrelevant to my spiritual needs.\nMissing was mysticism’s promise of the disappearance of I into a union with\nthe divine, the Heart Sutra’s eternal emptiness of form and the eternal form of\nemptiness that gifts with spiritual perspective and not-necessarily-logical intuition\nabout unseen Absolute Reality. Forced either-or, binary, card-turning cognition in\nthe search for God’s logic is unrewarding. As the Dalai Lama, in his Heart of\nWisdom Teaching, says, “…all phenomena are emptiness, without defining\ncharacteristics, they are not born, they do not cease…\" In trying to penetrate the\nmystery and promise of this emptiness, it was difficult to surrender my internal\nparody of what sounded like that day’s Southern California New Age stuff about\nglobal nonaggression, sexual politics, Beadles music, distressed jeans and pot. In\nthe synagogue of my neighborhood, experience with a deeply felt, never-you-mindabout-anything\nGod of detachment with love, was not on the menus of Friday night\nor Saturday morning services. All I could feel was a faithless and nonnegotiable\nfear.\nIn the work of many mysticism-positive scholars, a classic being Evelyn\nUnderhill’s Mysticism, 1961, it has been speculated that this ineffable state as a\nunion with a powerful unknown, transcending description in language, becomes\nmore socially prominent during times of cultural efflorescence. She pointed to the\n95\nflowering of mysticism in epochs of the high cultural achievements at the close of\nthe Classical Period in the Third Century, the Medieval Period in the Fourteenth\nCentury, the Renaissance in the Seventeenth Century and, now, as we know, in the\nWestern World toward the end of the Twentieth Century. An increase in general\nacceptance of talk, writing and practice focused on mystical experience is said by\nmany to accompany historical high points in intellectual, literary and political\nachievement. One might include as a component of our growing cultural richness,\nthe new science about chemical dialogues with the brain. Although no central\nnervous system agents were ever allowed in the ashrams of Baba Muktananda, it\nwas common during some evening sessions of questioning, called satsangs, for him\nto acknowledge that one or a few experiences with entheogenic agents can open\nmany recalcitrant folks to the existence of the God within. This, in turn, led them to\nthe drug free spiritual exercises, sadhana, of love, self-truth, and spontaneity (each\naccording to their nature) as well as abstinent discipline, meditation, chanting and\nyoga to maintain the knowledge. We might speak of participating in the creation and\nmaintenance of the spiritual ecology of ones inner and outer being. Underhill said\nthat the cultural richness of an efflorescent epoch is taken inward and accompanies\npersonal and societal mutations into states and institutions involving higher spiritual\nconsciousness.\nIn addition to an increase in the common outward manifestations of having\nhad a mystical experience, such as an increase in compassion, forgiveness and\nmore respectful and reverential attitudes toward the Earth and all its creatures\n(currently taking the forms of deep ecology, ecofeminism, herbal medicine, organic\nfarming and the like), these times bring more public consideration of the nature of\nreality itself, apart from its material manifestations. The theme of the life’s work of\nthe Dominican priest, Thomas Aquinas, made master of theology by papal\ndispensation in 1259, involved the existential recognition of this dichotomy of\nexistence, esse, and essence, nature and grace, the material world and God.\nWilliam James wrote famously about mystical experience penetrating the thin veil\nbetween these two worlds. Those with a mystical orientation attribute reality to inner\nexperience in relationship to a transcendental, supernatural world. Whereas\n96\neveryday events are subject to perceptual ambiguity and its attendant variety of\ninterpretations, mystical union is claimed to bring the existence and meaning of\nAbsolute Reality into direct experience. This kind of knowing is more akin to the\nPlatonic view of mathematics, that theorems have been everlastingly existent, from\nbefore our physical world, then it is to the here and now, physically based, finite\ncomputations involving the experimental machines of physics.\nThe philosopher-mathematician father of phenomenology, Edmund Husserl,\ncriticized the physics-want-to-be orientation of the 1860 empirical, objective\nmeasure psychologies of Fechner and Wundt. He understood the best of their\nfindings as simply correlations between subjective and observable events. Using\nmathematical discoveries as examples, Husserl spent his life arguing for the\npossibility of abstract truths relevant to mind being more reliable and valid if grasped\nvia direct experience. Knowing by what the popular mid-twentieth century writer of\nscience fiction, Robert Heinlein, called grocking it. This is antithetical to the attitudes\nof today’s human cognitive and brain sciences which disallow such knowing as\ndeeply suspect unless accompanied by objectively definable observables such as\nchanges in electrical or imaging indices of brain activity in one neural region or\nother. The modern psycholinguistics of brain mechanics can be called\nneolocationism. Using modern technology to measure regional blood flow, energy\nmetabolism and/or electrovoltage or magnetic field activity, stories of function are\nspun that closely resemble those imagined more than a century ago by the first\nlocationists, such as Ramon Cajal. These neuroanatomists spent thousands of\nhours looking at cell clusters and their connections in stained slides of human brain\ntissue using microscopes and imagined their singular and integrated function.\nToday, Lewis Judd, long time chairperson of the Department of Psychiatry at\nUCSD in La Jolla, carries a full sized, polymeric, three-dimensional model of the\nhuman brain when teaching his students about human subjective experience and\ninterpersonal behavior. In his weekly grand rounds, he explains that day’s\npsychiatric patient’s problems pointing here and there at regions in this plastic\nsurrogate for our electrical jellied brain. Few, if any, of the psychiatry students in his\nclass was inclined to ask the foundational question: how it is that a finger point and\n97\na name of a brain place can describe, much less explain in the language of physical\nor physiological mechanism, a patient’s illogical thoughts, feelings of hopelessness,\nirrational rage or prayerful gratitude. There remains a wide gap between ideas\nabout the mechanisms of human symbolic processing and those involving the\nstructures and functions of neuronal components and their connectivities in the\nbrain, particularly when perceived as regionally segmented meat. Yet this report of\nProfessor Judd’s finger-pointing plastic brain ritual should not elicit surprise since\niconic manipulation is certainly not new to the practices of priesthood.\nIn contrast with neuropsychiatry’s behavioral attributions to brain parts as an\nexplanatory pantheon of mysterious doers, absent of mechanical specifics, the\nfields of physics turn to more abstract and general mathematical and statistical, socalled\nphenomenological laws, such as those of thermodynamics and statistical\nmechanics. The accounts of Feynman’s abstract and general thermodynamic\ndevelopment of conservation of energy as well as equilibrium thermodynamics\ndiscussed previously serve as relevant examples. These abstract models have\nbeen found to capture the behavior common to diverse physical systems involving\n(often still unknown) differing physical mechanisms. Consistency of description,\nreliability, weighs in before predictive validity, which, with maturation of the research\narea, gradually becomes detailed mechanistic understanding with the eventual goal\nbeing derivation from the first principles of physics. The painful truth is that that in\nspite of evocative claims made to the contrary in the 1990-2000 Decade of the\nBrain, this level of understanding at the interface of neurobiological hardware and\nsoftware remains unbreached. Some recent attempts are interesting.\nOne of the current research themes about real single neurons in real brains\n(in contrast with the silicon chip modules used in neural network computer\nsimulations), involve widely distributed neurons that discharge in temporal\nsynchrony. These phenomena have been described by Max Planck’s Wolf Singer,\nChristoff Koch of California Institute of Technology and Florida Atlantic University’s\nSteven Bressler and others with words such as synchronization, phase locking,\ncoherence and binding. Binding is an intuitively seductive word that premises that\ntwo, even widely spatially separated, brain regions that manifest neuronal signals of\n98\nactivation locked together in time are assumed to be functionally integrated. Another\ntime-dependent neuronal characteristic of current interest involve neurons or\nneuronal clusters that beat with almost strict periodicity, the oscillatory pacemakers.\nFor example, the program of research by Professor Al Selverson at University of\nCalifornia at San Diego, among others, has elucidated the role of these rhythmic\npattern generators, both autonomous and those emerging from particular patterns\nof network connections. A wide variety of functional links involving neuronal\npacemakers has been demonstrated. They range from the oscillatory transport of\ncalcium through membrane channels in neurons and heart muscle, smooth muscle\noscillations of the pylorus muscle of the stomach, the neuronal ganglion driven\nchewing motions of the jaws of invertebrates and the retina-to-brain hypothalamic\ncells gating human circadian rhythms coupling our body’s hormonal clocks to light\ncycles.\nThough regular rhythmicity in neuronal discharges is an intuitively attractive\nidea and relatively easy to quantitate using simple sine wave trigonometric\ntransformations, in the real brain it is statistically rare. The commonest neuronal\ndischarge pattern observed is that of intermittent bursting, clusters of neuronal\ndischarges in time in which the inter-discharge intervals irregularly stretch and\ncontract like the bellow pleats of a syncopated accordion. Bursts of repeated firing\nof some unpredictable length followed by silences of equally mysterious durations.\nTheir behavior can be represented as statistical measures using non-normal, long\ntailed distributions and in-between entropies described previously. For a whole\nhuman example, although the rhythm of manic depression is commonly thought to\ninvolve periodic cycles, careful study using motility patterns of the timing through life\nof these episodes of extreme mood states by Professor Allan Gottschalk at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and others have demonstrated an irregularly intermittent\nbursting pattern in manic-depressive episodes, getting more frequent with age.\nNeuronal inter-discharge intervals seldom demonstrate what is called a regression\nto the mean like the normal distribution of heights, as one increases the number of\npeople measured, the tighter the distribution around the mean. Neurons, much like\nour own irregular pattern of doing things (in spite of our plans), the statistical\n99\ndistributions of neuronal interspike intervals have increasingly long tails. Contrary to\nthe behavior of a normally distributed observable, the larger the series of neuronal\nspike observed, the more likely that a longer interspike interval than had been seen\nbefore will occur. Counter-intuitively, long intervals tend to be followed by more long\nintervals as more shorts follow short intervals. Manic attacks cluster in time as does\na number of other brain and body diseases. Maybe it is intuitively obvious that bad\nstuff tends to cause more bad stuff and good stuff is self-propagating. Having\nsuffered recently does not mean fate owes you one. The brain’s syncopated\nsegmentations of time can be translated into a creatively arrhythmic dance.\nWhat makes neurologizing conversations like these about subtle human\nexperience possible are the human subjective scenarios we have agreed to short\nhand with names of brain parts and neurochemicals. The how is where conceptual\nconnection is filled with post 19 th Century Spanish microscopic neuroanatomist,\nSantiago Ramon y Cajal-like, intuitions about the functional role of brain structures:\nwe think motor automaticity and pacing when hearing the brain place names such\nas caudate, putamen and cerebellum; we think limbic lobe when musing about\nsexuality, rage and depression; we short hand left versus right hemispheric places\nfor verbal and sequential versus intuitive and geometric shape cognition; we point to\nthe frontal lobe for the future work of executive control, anticipation and paranoia;\nthe hypothalamus for primitively expressed appetites and to the brain stem for our\nvital functions such as breathing and blood pressure. With respect to the brain\njuices, we say dopamine for aggressive activity, norepinephrine for attention and\nsensory discrimination and serotonin for hunger, mood and sexual inclination. No\nmatter how avant guarde our experimental techniques such as monitoring local\nfunctional blood supply by fMRI, regional brain glucose utilization maps, timedependent\nchanges in skull surface voltage using a cap studded with\nelectroencephalographic, EEG, leads, monitoring these voltage field via their\ntransverse magnetic fields by the frozen helmets of magnetoencephalography,\nMEG, we conclude our work by calling forth named but still enigmatic brain parts\nand their juices as mysteriously powerful little men and women executing\nremarkably complex and subtle tasks, sometimes even when called upon.\n100\nCurrent neurochemical research using molecular biological tools such as\nmice knockouts (the ablation of specific proteins though interference with their\nnucleotide-mediated protein biosynthesis), for example, the production of animals\nmissing a subunit of their hippocampal glutamate receptors associated with the loss\nof some memory functions, conclude the memorial mechanism to be a specific\ncellular region, such as hippocampal CA3 cells. Technology advances but continues\nto support a primitive philosophic animism of named brain parts which pop science\nicons like the late Francis Crick called “The Amazing Hypothesis.” He and his fellow\nbrain philosophers implicate brain mechanisms such as the amygdaloidal nucleus\nman who can emotionally color even affectually neutral information that is\ntransported through him. Imaging data showing amygdala man lighting up is used to\ntell us that circulating sensory information through the differentially behaving\namygdaloid nucleus is used for fight or flight interpretive significance. Emotionally\nexpressive human faces light up inferior parietal cortex. The Iowa University\nProfessors, the husband and wife Damasios, have located even the criminal\npsychopath man in specific locations in the brain. As we have argued, perhaps ad\nnausem, using multimillion-dollar imaging and molecular biological technology and\nno new thoughts that weren’t around during the era of the 19th Century’s\nneuroanatomists, specific brain regions continue to gain implicative properties like\nthe task-specialized gods of the Roman and Greek pantheons. Crick implied that\nGod is a brain part.\nAt the same time, those of us that have been in the brain business for a\nwhile, recall skyscraper window washers, standing steady, high up on rope lashed\nplanks, suffering from congenital absence of the cerebellum, the supposed sine qua\nnon brain part supporting motor coordination and balance in humans. More\ngenerally, there is much evidence that if young enough and willing to work, many of\nthe functions of missing parts of the brain can be taken on remarkably well by other\nbrain parts thought not to be involved in these functions at all. In addition, since\nevidence of neuronal responding to loud noise or bright light perturbation can be\nfound almost everywhere in the hyper-connected human brain, because anticipation\nand brain time inversions make before and after indicate little about human\n101\nneuropsychological causality, and inhibitory on or off and activating on or off are a\npriori functionally equivalent with respect to the logic gates of information encoding,\ntransport or storage, the modern study of brain mechanisms in emotion, cognition\nand behavior remains almost as mysterious as ever.\n* * *\nThe only human mind-brain observations that are doubted consistently, and\ntreated as unpublishable by the editors of the journals of science, are those that\nresult from direct human experience using subjective reports from within. They are\ncalled unscientific. Often ignored are logically consistent mathematical and\ncomputational contexts, which, as abstract and general tools of thinking and\nimagining, have the capacity to frame, rigorously define and describe thinking about\nboth the subjective and objective aspects of brain-generated phenomena. These\nmathematically configured metaphors can lead to consistencies in description, this\nis behaving like that, in what are called equivalence relations expressed both as\nintuitive imagery; for a concrete example, a one holed bagel and one handled tea\ncup are topologically equivalent because, sculpting in clay, they can be smoothly\ntransformed into each other. We have seen that invariant measures in computable\nstatistical flows can come out of a mess of data. Professor Paul Rapp of the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania has been able to mathematically encode the verbal\ncontent of the patient’s free associations and the therapist’s responses, using tape\nrecordings of hours of psychoanalytical treatment. Examples of quantifiable qualities\nfound useful in this regard involve a variety of characteristic statistical patterns in\nwhat are called entropies and information as well as various measures of what with\na wide range of definitions is called complexity. These quantifiable properties,\nmeasures, can help in the struggle with the intrinsic tension of Absolute Reality\nbetween the “eternal emptiness of form and the eternal form of emptiness.” We\nresort to measures of entropy, information and complexity when confronted with our\nignorance, “emptiness,” great or little, with respect to either cause or result, about\nwhat exactly is going on. Entropy in its forms relevant to information quantifies our\n102\nignorance, the emptiness and its mystery. Computations of the entropy of systems\nin motion convert questions and answers concerning the detailed workings of the\nleg’s neuromuscular machinery to global statistical descriptions of more abstract\nthematic motifs, forms, expressed in the dance. Patterns of behavior of these\nproperties can suggest intuitive ideas and imagery about global mechanisms,\napproach/avoid, smooth/discrete, wild/tame, as well as correlated and objective\nphysical observables.\nTo learn more about this abstract, topology tinged (none numeric) style of\nmodel building, we can go to school on a long studied physical example. It connects\na simple and well understood real world observable with abstract statistical patterns\nresulting from motions using the one-to-one correspondence (the equivalence\nrelation called isomorphism) between their entropies. As we have discussed, the\nStanford mathematician and Field’s Medal Winner, Donald Ornstein, proved that in\nstatistical studies of even point-to-point unpredictable, chaotic systems, entropy is\nthe only isomorphism. The hardware of this physical example is what the statistical\nphysicists call a dilute gas of some fixed number, n, of uniform hard spheres,\nmoving scatterers, that, absent of dissipative friction, wander continuously around,\nchanging their directions when bumping into each other. In a two dimensional\nbounded arena of randomly rolling balls, this game has been called Sinai’s billiards.\nIt was named for previously mentioned Ya Sinai, an eminent Russian\nmathematician He is now at Princeton and was previously a student of Andrei\nNikolaevic Kolmogorov, the Russian guru of many of the Twentieth Century’s worldclass\nRussian mathematicians. Kolmogorov axiomatized the field of probability and,\nmore relevantly, initiated the theory of statistical descriptions, the ergodic theory, of\nnonlinear dynamical systems. In the language of statistical physics, we will see that\nthe same system produced by high number of elements executing Newton’s\ndeterministic laws can be generated by a so-called random system such as that\nresulting from flipping a suitably biased coin. Our example can also serve as a\nmetaphor, used extensively in the mathematical biology of the late Professor Art\nWinfree, for the temporal features of life on a topological circle: the natural\nirregularities of the recurrent beat of the heart, the in and out breathing of lungs, the\n103\nup and down voltage of brain waves, the pendulum swings of our blood hormone\nlevels, the cyclic procession of our days, months and years and at large scale, our\nbody’s journey from dust to dust.\nThe angular deviation theta, θ� �from the initial reference direction of a single\nmoving sphere, gets rotated to a new angle theta, θ\n→ θ\n’ �by a collision with another\nsphere. It has been shown that the new angle θ ’ is the previous angle, ��times twice\nthe average distance traveled between collisions called the mean free path, here\nsymbolized by delta, δ, divided by the diameter, D, of the sphere. Algebraically,\nθ ’ �=�\n2δ θ ��the new angle is equal to twice the mean free path divided by the diameter\nD\nof the spheres times the original directional angle of the sphere’s motion. �If we\nsymbolize the time between collisions with tau, τ, after an elapsed time of\nexperimental observation, t, we can say that the deviations from the initial direction\nof the sphere changes like ( 2 δ � t/τ . The exponent, t/τ, represents the time of the\nD\nexperimental observation divided by the average time between collisions of the\nspheres, i.e. the time we’ve been watching, t, is expressed as units of inter-collision\ninterval, τ. Of course, the circular deviation in the angle from the initial direction\nrotates repeatedly around a circle as the number of collisions increase. If a point on\na circle marks the angular change resulting from each collision and the system runs\nlong enough, it has been shown that the circle will eventually be completely covered\nby points.\nAn estimate of the entropy, S, being generated by each sphere labeled with\nsome index i, Si, is positive because the recurrent motion is deviating continuously\nfrom the initial direction. It can be computed for each sphere as the logarithm of the\nintercollision time-averaged deviation from the initial direction, S i = 1 log( 2 δ\n) and the\nτ D\nentropy of the whole n hard sphere system is the sum of the n entropies, which can\nbe expressed as n× S i . If we keep books by registering the points when each\nsphere’s  ’ makes a stop on the top half of the sphere’s circle as 1 and the bottom\nhalf as 0 (and we must arbitrarily decide between 0 and 1 if it falls exactly on the\n104\ndivision between top and bottom and do so in a consistent way), then we can keep\nscore with a random looking binary series such as 11001001010…. that describes\nthe sequence of rotations. The advantage that accrues by doing so is that this coin\nflip counting eliminates details in favor of a computable over all measure and\nsupports several forms of entropy calculations for its use in deciding if this system is\nbehaving like that system, an equivalence relation. One can imagine a series of coin\nflips with 1 being heads and 0 being tails such that the statistics of a characteristic\nseries is determined by the fairness of the coin. As noted above, Donald Ornstein’s\nfamous theorem says that the entropy of these kinds of hardware and software\nsystems is the only general basis for finding correspondence between\ncharacterizations of two such irregularly behaving systems. The important idea here\nis that a series of 1’s and 0’s may not be identical but the two systems can be\nisomorphically equivalent with respect to their entropy.\nNotice again that the physical process of hard spheres bouncing off each\nother on a flat surface has been captured by an abstract representation in binary\nnumbers that, like a series of coin flips, can be quantified as entropies (which would\nbe maximal for an ideal, fair coin). After describing the process of real number\nrepresentation by the binary code, we will show how entropies can be computed for\nthese binary series. We remind ourselves that we are struggling to obtain some kind\nof knowing in a representative system manifesting the tension and mystery between\nemptiness and form.\nWe can translate all finite real numbers into this language, making them\naccessible to standard entropy computations. The following discussion of the\nprocess of transforming numbers into binary series is in the spirit of the famous\nnumber theory theorem that every natural number (the positive integers such as 1,\n2, 3, 4…) can be expressed as the sum of at most four squared numbers. Encoding\nany number by a series of 0’s or 1’s in what is called a binary transformation, begins\nwith its separation, called partition, into a sum of powers of 2, for example, 100 = 64\n(2 6 ) + 32 (2 5 ) + 4 (2 2 ). A short hand description of this sum begins with a form\nindicating the presence or absence of each successive power by a 1 or 0 coming\nbefore the relevant power of two; i.e. 100 = 1 × 2 6 + 1 × 2 5 + 0 × 2 4 + 0 × 2 3 + 1 ×\n105\n2 2 + 0 × 2 1 + 0 × 2\n0 (in which the last term, arbitrarily, is 2 0 = 1, since anything to\nthe power 0 = 1). This can be written even more simply as a series of 0’s or 1’s,\ntheir presence indicating whether the power represented by each place in the left to\nright descending sequence of powers of two participates in the sum of the partition.\nIt is in this way that in binary numbers, 100 = 110010. As another example, if we\nsimilarly partition the decimal number 729 = 512 (2 9 ) + 128 (2 7 ) + 64 (2 6 ) + 16 (2 4 ) +\n8 (2 3 ) + 1(2 0 ), we find that its binary transformation results in 729 = 1011011001,\nthe 0’s representing the descending powers of two that are absent in the powers of\ntwo partition. One can compute the binary representations of lower valued numbers\nimmediately; for example, 4 = 1 × 2 2 + 0 × 2 1 + 0 × 2 0 so that there is a 1 in the\nmultiply-the-power-of- two column and 0 the power 1 and power 0 columns so in\nbinary representation, 4 = 100. Similarly, 6 = 1 × 2 2 + 1 × 2 1 + 0 × 2 0 making the\nbinary transformation of 6 = 110.\nIt was the co-inventor (with Isaac Newton) of the calculus, Gottfried Wilhelm\nLeibniz, in about 1665, who fully developed the binary representation of all decimal\nnumbers. In a state of wonderment about the simplicity, power and completeness of\nthis 1 and 0 encoding, he is said to have the beliefs that 0 symbolized the\nemptiness of the universe’s beginnings, 1 represented the complete fullness of God\nand that this transformation served as metaphoric evidence consistent with God’s\ncreation of the universe out of nothing.\nThe simplicity of binary expressions as in the dynamics of hard spheres or\nrotations on the circle as well as the transformations such as 729 = 1011011001\nmake them propitious for exemplifying the methods for computing the entropies of\nthe growth rate of the possible, called the topological entropy, H T , and the probable,\nthe metric entropy, H M , which was introduced in a previous chapter called “Sensual\nIn-Between Entropies.” The following exemplify the computations of measures of\ntopological and metric entropies, H T and H M , another computable idea called\nalgorithmic complexity, AC and finally, the well known (to statisticians) standard run\nscore, src. Their descriptions have as their purpose a demonstration for the reader\nthat these apparently abstract, perhaps nebulous sounding, words can be\ntransformed into well-defined, concrete, quantitative and computable form of reality.\n106\nIf acceptance of this idea does not constitute a problem for the reader (and you do\nnot find it fun to follow along with a computer math program and/or a pencil), then\nthe following several paragraphs can be quickly scanned or skipped entirely.\nThe computations of H T and H M begins with keeping track of how many 0 →\n1 and 1 → 0 transitions are found going from left to right in the binary series. For\nexample, in the binary expression of 729, 1011011001, one starts counting with a\n1→ 0 transition followed by a 0 → 1 transition and then a 1 → 1 transition and so\non. A useful way to record the count is via entries into a 2 × 2 matrix for score\nkeeping in which the horizontal rows are labeled 0 on top and 1 below and the\nvertical columns are labeled 0 on the left and 1 on the right. The number of each\nkind of transitions (from the vertical label to the horizontal label) are counted and\nsummed in the appropriate box of the two box by two box matrix; for examples: for a\n0 → 0 transition, a tally mark is entered in the upper left corner of the matrix; for a 0\n→1 transition, a tally mark is entered in the upper right corner; a 1→ 0 tally goes in\nthe left lower corner and a 1→ 1 is tallied in the right lower corner. The resulting\ntransition incidence counting matrix, M t for the 729 binary transformation series\nlooks like M t = 1 3\nindicating one 0 → 0, three 0 → 1, three 1 → 0, and two 1 → 1\n3 2\ntransitions have been tallied. Although this series alone is too short for computing\nreliable statistical measures, if we assume that the pattern of transitions observed in\nthis short series is stationary, that is its transition behavior will remain the same if\nthe binary series continued on to be infinite in length, the assumption being that the\ndynamics of now will be the same as always, 729 will stay 729, then we can use two\nforms of this transition matrix in the computation of the topological entropy reflecting\nthe growth rate of the possible, HT, and the metric entropy from the statistical\nweights of allowed choices among them, the probable, H M .\nTo obtain the entropy representing the growth rate over time of the new\npossibles, the computation of H T , the topological entropy, involves first transforming\nM t into an transition incidence matrix, M t,i a 0 or 1 matrix indicating whether each\nbox has been entered at all (or not). Since in the binary representation of 729, all\n107\nfour boxes of M t are occupied, the M t,i =\n1 1\n1 1\nindicates that all four kinds of\ntransitions are possible. Since we remain in the context of a 0,1, two state system,\nthe growth rate of the possible equals the logarithm, base two, of the sum of the\nentries in the boxes of the left-top-row to right-bottom-row diagonal called the trace\nand HT = log 2 (1 + 1) = log 2 (2) = 1. Consistent with intuition, since every transition is\npossible, the topological entropy of M t as indicated in its M t,i is maximal (= 1).\nAnother expression equal to the sum of the trace (the sum of the upper left to lower\nright diagonal) in a square matrix, is its leading eigenvalue, most often symbolized\nwith a lambda, λ 1 . The logarithm of the leading eigenvalue of the transition\nincidence matrix is equal to its topological entropy. Symbolically, H T (M t,i ) = log 2 (λ 1 )\n= log 2 (2 ) = 1. Standard elementary linear algebra texts describe how to compute\neigenvalues, these relations and related operations as well as their foundational\ntheorems.\nBefore computing the entropy of the distribution of probabilities among the\npossibles as the metric entropy, H M , let us notice again that the occupancies in the\nfour entry boxes of the transition matrix M t are not uniform, M t =\n1 3\n3 2\n. This leads\nnaturally to the intuition that for this series of binary transitions, HM, in contrast with\nH T , will not be maximal, i.e. not equal to 1 and the nonuniformity of H T and H M is a\ncomputational expression of what we mean by a state of in-between entropy. These\nentropies are identical and their difference = 0 for transitions reflecting maximal\nentropy, as might be realized in a very long series of fair coin flips in which the\nentropies = 1. Entropy will be minimal when flipping a two headed coin, here the\nentropies = 0. More compactly, the non-uniform probabilistic, metric entropy,\ndiffering from the maximal topological entropy indicates that the system is in a\ndynamical state of in-between entropy, written as H T - H M ≠ 0.\nIn the computation of the metric entropy, H M , the M t is transformed into a\ntransition probability matrix, M t,p , called a Markov matrix named for one of the two\ngreat Russian mathematicians, both students of Pafnuti Lvovich Chebyshev, the\nMarkov brothers. The entries of each row in the M t are transformed into transition\n108\nprobabilities, so that the sum of the decimal fraction parts of all the boxes in each\nhorizontal row add up to 100%, or as a real number, 1.00. Recall that in the\nexample we’ve been using, the binary expansion of the natural number 729, the\n1 3\ntransition incidence matrix is M t = and its Markov matrix is top row, 1/4, 3/4\n3 2\nand bottom row 3/5 , 2/5, i.e. M\nt,p =\n0.25 0.75\n. Matrix multiplication of Mt,p by itself\n0.60 0.40\nrepeatedly is equivalent to tracking the temporal evolution of the transition matrix’s\nprobabilities until the resulting matrices move toward, converge onto, a steady state;\neach self matrix multiplication step represents what results from the passage of one\nunit of time. The convergence to equilibrium values is continuous and gradual.\nWhen the steady state is reached, both rows become identical. For this example,\nM t,p × M t,p or M t,p 2 =\n0.5125 0.4875\n; M\n0.3900 0.6100\nt,p 4 =\n0.4527 0.5472\n; Mt,p 8 0.4445 0.5554\n= ;\n0.4377 0.5622 0.4443 0.5556\nM\nt,p 16 =\n0.4444 0.5555\n0.4444 0.5555\nwhich for the first four decimal places remain the same for\nadditional times of self multiplication. Note the convergence of the top and bottom\nrows to the same asymptotic values. Books discussing the multiplicative and other\nbehavior of these nonnegative matrices are numerous and frequently appear in\nmatrix algebra texts under the rubric of the Frobenius-Perron theorems.\nUsing the entropy formalism of Claude Shannon as developed previously, H M\nis computed as the sum across either of the identical rows of each probability times\nits logarithm, �ρ � �× log(ρ � �����ρ 2 × � �log(ρ 2 )) remembering from above that we are working in\nbase 2 logarithms and to change the minus sign (resulting from taking the\nlogarithms of decimal fractions) to plus: H M (M t,p ) = .4444 × log(.4444) + .5555 ×\nlog(.5555) = .9911 The nonuniformity of the box occupancy probabilities is reflected\nin the difference between the topological (maximal estimate) and metric (minimal\nestimate) entropies and is therefore quantifiable and computable: H T - H M ≠ 0 = 1.00\n- 0.9911 = 0. 0089. If the maximal and minimal estimates of the entropy were equal\nand all the probabilities boxes in each row asymptotically contained the same\n109\nprobabilities as in M t =\n0.5 0.5\n, it would retain these values across an infinite\n0.5 0.5\nnumber of self multiplications such that HM = .5 × log(.5) + .5 × log(.5) = 1 and H T -\nH M = 1.00 – 1.00 = 0. 0.\nComplexity is a more general and variously defined descriptive expression\nthan that of the topological and metric entropies and as such brings with it many\nkinds of definitions and computational approaches. One choice that’s intuitively\nappealing assumes that the relative complexity of an expression representing, say\nan outcome of an observation or experiment, is reflected in the minimum length of\nthe most compressed program (algorithm) from which, given a suitable dictionary of\nsymbolic equivalencies, one can reconstitute the original expression. Increases in\nwhat some have called algorithmic complexity, AC, are reflected in the growth of\nthis minimally descriptive symbol series length. Karen Selz’s approach to\ncompression and AC, similar to one proposed by Paul Rapp, involves the\nidentification and symbolic representation of repeated blocks of symbols called\nwords. For example, given an arbitrary, exemplifying binary series:\n011011101010001010101001001010011, we first find the longest repeated word\n[1010100] and represent it with the symbol, a, yielding a shortening in the original\nseries, 011011a010a1010011. The next longest repeated word is [011] is replaced\nwith b, yielding a further compression, bba010a1010b. The next remaining binary\nword is of length equal to the previous one, [010], which, when replaced by c results\nin the series bbaca1cb. This can be further compressed to the final representation\nwith four symbols and for the sequentially repeated b, one exponent of degree two,\nb 2 aca1cb. From this representation and a dictionary of letter equivalent words, the\noriginal binary expression can be recovered. For a quantitative index of the\nalgorithmic complexity, AC, of the compression, Selz computes the sum of the\nnumber of distinct symbols plus the sum of the natural logarithms of the exponents:\n4 + log (2) = 4.6931. The binary representation of 729, 1011011001, discussed\nabove, is compressed by making two [101]’s = a and two 0’s = b resulting in a 2 1b 2 1.\nHaving three distinct symbols, a,b, and 1, and two exponents of two, its algorithmic\ncomplexity is equal to, AC = 3 + 2 × log(2) = 4.38.\n110\nIn addition to H T , H M and AC, if computable in a meaningful way, the\ndeviation of the binary series under study from the idealized random behavior of a\nfair coin could serve as another index of complexity. Common descriptions of the\namount of randomness in a series are indices of run length If a run length is defined\nby number of elements in a series of the same symbol before it stops, counting the\nnumber of run boundaries by reading along the binary series and counting the\nnumber of switches from 0 →1 or 1 → 0, then the binary expression of 729,\n1011011001, has six runs. The great analytic probabilist, William Feller, among\nmany others, including the distinguished 18 th Century Swiss family of\nmathematicians, the Bernoulli’s, proved that computing a standard run score, srs,\ninvolves three terms, the theoretical expectation, E, of the number of runs, r, that is\nE(r), the number of runs actually observed, Obs(r) and the variance of the\nexpectation of the number of runs, Var( E(r). If the srs is less than zero, then the\nbinary series is more random than that resulting from the flipping of a fair coin.\nInterestingly, when a normal group of subjects are instructed to simulate what they\nthink of as a random coin flip determined series of 0’s and 1’s, their srs tends to be\nlower than zero, over-estimating the degree of irregularity that randomness\nrepresents. Long runs occur by chance far more often than intuition would dictate. If\nsrs is more than zero, than the binary, coin-flip series is more ordered than random.\nIf srs equal to zero, the binary series is not discriminable from fair coin flipping\nrandomness.\nThe expected number of runs, E(r), can be estimated by a fraction formed by\ntwice the product of the number of heads times tails divided by the sum of the\nheads and tails to which is added one. That is, E(r) = 2 × 6 × 4 + 1 = 5.8. The average\n6+\n4\nvariation around this expectation called the variance, Var, of the expectation,\nVar(E(r)), is estimated by a fraction formed by (take a breath) twice the product of\nthe number of heads times tails × twice the product of the number of heads times\ntails minus the number of heads and minus the number of tails, all over the product\nof the sum of the heads and tails squared, times the sum of the number of heads\n111\n(2× 6× 4)(2× 6× 4 −6−4)\nand tails minus one. That is, Var(E(r)) = = 2.03 . From these\n2\n(6 + 4) × (6 + 4 −1)\nthree terms, we compute srs =\nEr () − Obsr () 5.8−\n6,0\n= =− 0.140 . We conclude that\nVar( E( r) 2.03\nthe standard run score of the binary series is less than zero and therefore more\nrandom than the expected random behavior of a fair coin.\nRecall from the last chapter that Karen Selz, Martin Paulus and others have\nshown that various personality types and psychiatric diagnoses are associated with\ncharacteristic deviations of srs from zero. When the winners of the 2002 Annual\nWorld Rock, Paper Scissors Championships held in Montreal Canada were\ninterviewed, they said that sensing their opponent’s characteristic style of deviations\nfrom randomness in what we would call the continuum from maximal to minimal\nentropy determined their successes. We characteristically use all of these measures\nto estimate quantitate the deviation from randomness standard run score, srs,\nalgorithmic complexity, AC, as well as H T and H M ,, the topological and metric\nentropies.\n* * *\nThe encounter with mystical Absolute Reality, though sought by arduous\ncontemplative and other practice, emerges spontaneously, most often during times\nof apparent mental emptiness, detachment, a state in which rationally instructive\nthought and the choral background of brain voiced, emotion-ladened, commentary\nhave disappeared into the entropic soup of formless silence. It is this indescribable,\nineffable, stillness that we think serves as the psychophysiological anlage of\nmystical experience. The mathematical systems yielding quantitative metaphors,\ndescriptive ideas about dynamical entropic statistical emptiness and form inspire the\nuse of mathematical structures in place of localized lumps in brain meat as\npersonalized icons of doing.\nOur wedding of well-defined mathematical objects to metaphoric elements of\nmore general nonverbal intuition has a long tradition. Rene Thom’s 1990 book,\n112\nSemiophysics, discusses mathematical mechanisms and their representations in\nmind and the real world, analogizing mathematical objects and the intuitions they\ngenerate to mechanical tools. Similar ideas are found among the four liberal arts of\nthe ancients: Number, Geometry, Music and Cosmology. The epistemologies of all\nfour require, then and now, the intuitive use of mathematical objects, conscious or\nunconscious. Examples can be found in conceptual issues of Geometry and\nNumber with implications for relationships between man’s physical and\npsychological worlds. One set of articulations were attributed to the shapes of\nPlatonic solids found among the Neolithic stone circles in Aberdeenshire, Scotland,\n2000 years before Plato. Each symbolized particular physical and psychological\nthemes. All manifested equal edges and every face of each solid was the same\nperfect polygon. The solid with four equilateral triangles manifesting four vertices\nand faces, the tetrahedron, represented the physical element, Fire, and the\npersonal psychological climate of a choleric, fiery nature. A Platonic solid composed\nof eight equilateral triangular faces, two tetrahedrons annealed, the octahedron,\nsignified Air in physical composition and optimistic hopefulness in psychological\ndisposition. Six square faces together making a cube, evoked the elemental\nphysical component, Earth, and its human expression as a phlegmatic, apathetic\npersonal style. Twenty faces, all equilateral triangles, constitute an icosahedron\nindicating Water and a dominant feeling state of melancholic sadness. Like\nonomatopoeic words and pictorial script, the three dimensional geometry of these\nPlatonic solids feel like what they came to symbolize.\nThe personality styles symbolized and evoked by the Platonic solids continue\nto be used to this day. For example, they compose the basic elements of the\nconstitutional categories of remedy in homeopathic medicine as introduced over\n200 years ago by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in his classical Organon of the Medical\nArt. The assignment of clinical remedy in homeopathic treatment combines\nconsideration of the presenting physical symptoms and signs, the what, with\nintuitive discernment of the patient’s constitutional type, the who. To the\nhomeopathic physician, tetrahedral fire is suggested by the traits of personal\nmagnetism, courage and inspiration as well as egotism, strong desire and rage.\n113\nOctahedral Air people intellectualize objectively in confident and insensitive\naloofness. Those symbolized by cubic Earth are realistic and practical, a what-yousee-is-what-there-is\nbelief along with rigid, materialistic ways. Icosahedral Water\ntypes experience emotions strongly and are sensitive, intuitive, nurturing and can be\noverly sensitive and dependent.\nWhat intuitions and observations relevant to self, subjective and objective,\nemanate from the stylistic properties of feelings as derived from a time series of\nobservations of their associated actions suggested by their statistical measures, H T ,\nH M , AC and srs? The yield is rich and unexpected. We find an enjoining of values of\nthese measures, characteristic and invariant for each person, with the brain and\nbehavioral actions of entheogenic agents and Zen meditation in contrast with\nworldlier focused attitude adjusting experiences and drugs. The range of their\npotential values helps rationalize a person’s inclinations along the continuum of\nattachment and detachment. This quantifiable dimension augers positively and\nnegatively with respect to the requirements for mystical experience as poetically\ndescribed by the ambivalent warrior prince, Ardjuna, in conversations with Lord\nKrishna in the Bhagavad-Gita, the most famous and influential component of the\nMahabharata of Hindu scripture, A similar theme relevant to the occupancy of a\npropitious range of values for the measures, H T , H M , AC and srs, is found in what is\noften called the Second Nobel Truth as explained by the Buddha, Siddhartha\nGautama, in lectures recorded in a deer park near Benares. We begin with the\nresults of some drug experiments conducted by behavioral neurophysiologists and\nend with suggestions about the intuitive relevance of the conceptual content of\nthese measures to the universals of mystical experience and perhaps to elements\nof spiritual transformation.\nAs described previously, the brain and behavioral process of habituation is\ncharacterized by a decrease in the strength of an observable response to the\nrepetition of an evocative stimulus. Imagine the decrease in our startle responding\nwhen a once unexpected loud noise continues to occur. Sir Charles Sherrington,\nthe early Twentieth Century British pioneer in neurophysiology showed that animals\nand humans gradually stopped the withdrawal of their limbs with stimulation of its\n114\nskin when it was repeated several times. Columbia University’s Nobelist in the brain\nsciences, Eric Kandel studied the neural mechanisms of habituation as a primitive,\naccessible and fundamental example of learning, the association of a nonresponse\nto a usually evocative stimulus, in Aplysia californica. The sea snails learned not to\nrespond to a local irritation with a gill-withdrawal response when exposed to it many\ntimes. They learned to stop paying attention to the perturbation. The background\nnoise appears to disappear after a little time in the Mall. Though his exploration of\nits synaptic mechanisms involved the neural circuit of the gill-withdrawal reflex in the\nmarine snail, its generality and human relevance is well established. Hundreds of\npapers can be found reporting the results of studies of habituation in normal\nhumans under all kinds of circumstances as well as in psychopathological\nconditions. That it samples something both fundamental and persistent is suggested\nby studies in children by one of Kandel’s students, Michael Lewis. He found that the\nrate of habituation of a startle response to a bright light in one-year-old human\ninfants predicted success in many kinds of learning and other cognitive functions\nwhen the children were tested again at the age of four. Pavlov’s experiments\nstudied habituation of the classically conditioned salivary response to meat powdercoupled\nbell sounds in dogs in which the bell was followed by nothing, not only led\nto inhibition of the salivary response with unreinforced trial repetition but\ngeneralization of the inhibitory state such that dogs were observed to freeze in\nmotionless catatonic states for hours. In the language of our statistical measures,\nthe fixation of the dog’s behavior would manifest minimal entropy in the form of H T =\nH M = 0 and the lowest complexity values for AC and srs. Entheogenic agents like\nLSD or mescaline inhibit the process of habituation and fixation, maximizing the\nentropy of behavioral measures, H T , H M → 1 and high complexity values for AC and\nsrs.\nMark Geyer and David Braff, Professors at the University of California in La\nJolla and Michael Davis, a Professor at Yale’s School of Medicine, found that\nentheogenic agents, such as mescaline and LSD, as well as naturally occurring\nindoleamines, such as DMT, which occurs naturally in human brain, prevented\nhabituation of startle responding in mammals. Each sound repetition was treated as\n115\nthough it were new. The baby is Buddha is an Eastern philosophical aphorism that\ncaptures the fresh spiritual state of each moment’s openness and readiness, the inbetween\nentropies for new information surprise. Geyer and Martin Paulus found that\nentheogenic agents such as Ecstasy also increased the complexity of the patterns\nof spontaneous motor movement made by rats exploring a bounded space. Recall\nthat they partitioned the floor to document the exploratory motion in the context of a\nsequence of location transitions, readying the data for the computation of some of\nthe measures previously described. Following the administration of entheogenic\nagents, the partitioning of the space that the animals were exploring, into a lattice of\ndiscrete boxes and the encoding of each square with a symbol, the computable\nentropic and complexity measures such as H T , H M , AC and srs were increased. In\ncontrast, the administration of amphetamine-like stimulants led to a different kind of\nbehavioral activation than that induced by entheogenic agents. The measures of H T ,\nH M , AC and srs reflected decreases in entropy and complexity. As University of\nCalifornia’s David Segal and others documented in the 1960’s, high doses of\namphetamine led to animals into in a minimal entropic state, they were frozen in\nstereotyped rocking, nodding and circling motions. High dose amphetamine-treated\nhumans develop rigid fixation of ideas, low H T , H M , AC and srs, in man this is seen\nas inescapable obsession and paranoid delusion. There is considerable medical\nevidence that Hitler took large doses of amphetamine (Benzedrine) daily for the last\n20 years of his life.\nThe entheogenic drug-induced phenomena of naïve openness and absence\nof fixation, states of high entropy and complexity, behavior generating higher than\ncontrol measures tending toward maximal values of H T , H M , AC and srs , are\nsubjectively reflected in the results of personal experiments of University of\nChicago’s Heinrich Kluver as described in his Mescal and Mechanisms of\nHallucinations (1966). Observing himself after the self administration of a crude\npreparation of peyote cactus, he said that it led to glad feelings of unfamiliarity and\na marked reduction in his tendency for boredom (habituation), a detachment from\nold ways of thinking and a new openness to a rush of seen again for the first time\nexperiences. Everything in his personal world, no matter how mundane, became a\n116\nsource of new interest and fascination. New thoughts replaced old ideas in a\ncontinuing process of new formulation. All of these things feel like they emerge\nspontaneously, making ideas about being born again and personal renewal\nconcrete. We remember that Timothy Leary and his wife in their privately circulated\npamphlet, Neurologic, described their entheogenic drug-induced escape from the\nhabitual order as supported by the learned and established “…mental-manipulative\nand socio-sexual brain circuits…,” an escape to a fresh new planet of possibilities.\nLouis Lewin, the early Twentieth Century German pioneering ethnopharmacologist\ndescribed his subjective responses to peyote as a flood of lively, numerous, random\nfantastic creations of perception and thought, all demanding his fresh attention.\nTo complement these subjective reports, experimental tasks involving\nhabituation, such as the disappearance of a brain wave sign of arousal to sound or\nlight stimulation, called alpha blocking, the eyes-closed resting pattern of 8-14\ncycles per second, hz, waves perturbed into the arousal pattern of >20 hz, did not\nhabituate when the subjects were pretreated with entheogenic drugs. This finding\nwas also true for the results of years of meditative practice. In his 1974\nPsychophysiology of Zen, Hirai reported that Soto Zen monks, after many years of\npractice in mindful, one pointed, be here now meditation, unlike normal controls,\ncontinued to show alpha blocking surprise, brain wave arousal patterns, throughout\nthe course of repeated stimulation with auditory clicks.\nJames Austin in his monumental book, Zen and the Brain (2000) summarizes\nother studies of habituation in TM practitioners and other mediators in which eyes\nopen versus eyes closed, the set and setting and variations in other experimental\nvariables blurred these results to some degree. He develops the case that years of\nmeditation-induced brain states of emptiness, we would say of maximal entropy and\nminimal form, set the stage for the ecstatically insightful flood accompanying the\nsudden insight into a Zen koan’s solution or the transcendent startle induced by a\nroshi’s shout. A meditative struggle concerns how one can think about not thinking.\nThat is, thinking of nothing. This is generally thought to be the most important part\nof Zen meditation, called zazen. Achieving high values for brain and behavioral H T ,\nH M , AC and srs supply the formless infrastructure for ecstatic transformation.\n117\nIn healthy people, an awareness of self is not lost during this time of invasion\nby and fusion with what feels like an independent agency. At full force, the mystical\nexperience is transfixing, tending to paralyze movement and speech, and at the\nsame time bringing with it the capacity for clear sensory and sensory-integrative\nlucidity. This new seeing brings previously unnoticed things to attention and makes\nold things new. Perhaps most striking is the passive (unsought) experience of the\nunification of erstwhile disparate, apparently unrelated thoughts and feelings. The\nyield can be the sudden emergence of deep relationships between apparently very\ndifferent constructs, beliefs and formalisms leading to unanticipated and unsought\nintegrative connections. In mathematics, this experience can lead to entirely new\nkinds of theorems and proofs; in the physical and biological sciences, a previously\nunseen organization of the data generating new global relationships and potential\nscientific laws. In our spiritual life, the ineffable richness of the direct experience of\nGod.\nMysticism-negative interpretations of these experiences have always been\nattendant. To the extent that the mystic’s inward turn is seen as a detachment and\nimplicit derogation of the external, consensually real world, it is often seen as\nalienating from established institutions of religion and government. Psychoanalytic\npractitioners may label it a regression to primary narcissism. Most churches tend to\ndiscourage its practice as counter to the dominant social hierarchy and its\ngovernance. Governments pass laws against its practice and manifestations, a\ncurrent example being modern Chinese governmental reactions to the Tibetan\nBuddhism of the Dalai Lama and the yogic practices of the Falon Gong. Agencies of\nestablished society such as the institutions of licensed medical practice make the\ndominance of the inner world of mysticism subject to diagnoses ranging from the\nnarcissistic character disorders to interpretations of the reported extraordinary\nexperiences as manifestations of schizophrenia, manic-depressive disorder or\ntemporal lobe epilepsy. Rejection and fear of the transcendent states lead to\nuninformed and politicized anti-narcotic laws, grouping heroine and cocaine with the\nentheogenic (recall: engendering connection with the sacred within) agents such as\nthe Huichol Indian’s peyote and the Amazonian Indian’s yage, obstruct and socially\n118\ntaint the personal use of plants and practices that facilitate access to the mystic\nway. Rational, socially responsible and otherwise kind and tolerant Presbyterians,\nUnitarians and Reformed Jews can be suspicious and rejecting of what appears to\nthem as the politically tinged mass hysteria of praying in tongues and other rituals of\nCharismatic Christian rebirth and renewal or the ecstatic states of Orthodox Jewish\nchant-dancing.\nModern brain and behavioral scientists, remaining under the philosophical\nspell of logical positivism and its requirement for operational definitions and\n(external) experimental disconfirmability, operate from the position of strong doubt\nwhen mystical experience is addressed. What is striking and strange about how\nscience plays the game of mysticism research is exemplified by the publishable\nincrement in credibility concerning a meditation-induced change in state of\nconsciousness when Boston University’s William Benson reported the\naccompanying relaxation response, a sudden decrease in heart rate---much like the\ndive reflex of a seal or what the heart rate does when you duck your head suddenly\nforward into a sink full of water. Decades are spent getting professorial tenure for\nresearch yielding things we have already experienced and know directly and for\nourselves. Recall that the existence of visual imagery in the human, doubted by an\nexperimental psychology of the time in which William James self-exploratory\nobservations were viewed as revolutionary, was made more credible by evidence\nfor the existence of a subjective spatial metric: verbally reporting subjects, when\ntimed, took longer in their minds to go from one room to another one that was down\nthe hall then going to the room that was immediately next door.\nWe use brain chemical, pharmacological, neurophysiological and\nneuroanatomical localization and computation of characteristic statistical patterns in\ntime dependent brain and behavioral observations to the same end.\nFurther Readings for SOME ENTHEOGENIC ENTROPIES\n119\nPhantastica: A Classic Survey on the Use and Abuse of Mind-Altering Plants.

After years of perhaps too academic\nconversations with their parents, visits to a variety of houses of worship, talks with\nUniversity of California religion professors and evenings with a Ph.D. psychologistrabbi\nand friends at the neighborhood synagogue, they turned somewhere else.\nSome of their high school friends who were Evangelical Christians took them to\ntheir Assembly of God, Pentecostal and other Christian, direct experience of God,\nchurches. They came to love what they sometimes called their Wednesday night\nand Sunday morning “rock and roll,” services.\nStruggling with the post-Vietnam cynical mistrust of authority and the\nmarijuana apathetic nihilism of the 60’s and 70’s, and clearly not enticed by what\nthey regarded as their father’s vacuous mélange of New Age Eastern Religions and\nsecular brain science, they spoke about their sudden and life-changing experiences.\nThey studied, memorized and quoted the Scriptures as part of their commitment to\ntheir word churches. As erstwhile cynical teenagers, now positive and brimming with\nfaith, I secretly called it denial, they described what was happening to them as New\n122\nBirth. They told me that, paraphrasing Paul in Romans, they had been saved and\nwere living New Life, not earned by good works as in Hebraic Law, but by faith\nthrough God’s Grace. Jesus had “paid their bills” through His sacrifice at\nGethsemane. They both tried to explain inexplicable feelings of new energy, the\nunseen hand of spiritual guidance and peace. One told me that the wind of the Holy\nGhost had taken him to the front of the pulpit, tearfully, thankfully, on his knees, to\naccept Jesus as his personal Savior. They described how they had opened their\nlives to the spiritual strength of living in Jesus.\nMany things about them changed: their tastes in food, from hamburgers to\nvegetables and fruit; from the jazz of John Coltrane and McCoy Tyner and the\ncynicism of Frank Zappa’s “…only fourteen and knows how to nasty…,” to playing\nstrum guitar and singing the hymns of Wednesday night healing services; from t-\nshirts hanging out of raggedy, Southern California, boutique store purchased,\nstressed jeans, to polished dark shoes, starched white shirts and gray or tan khaki\nslacks, sometimes with ties. They became cool, respectful, rational and more\ndistant with me. They repeated often the scriptural story about young Jesus,\naccidentally separated from his parents on a visit to Jerusalem. When by standers\nasked Him about where His parents were, He answered, “I have no mother and\nfather.” They told me that they, like God’s son Jesus, were filled to completeness\nwith the Father and the Holy Ghost.\nOn one hand, their experiences sounded like those of the activated mind\nstate of Abraham Abulafia, a suddenly emergent Nevesh and my father’s\nmetaphysical talks about personal transformation. My personal secularcomputational\nbrain God spoke to me of the mechanisms of sudden personality\nchange, a phase transition in complex systems, in the context of the nonlinear\ndynamics of brain and behavior. On the other hand, their global changes in mind felt\nboth alien and threatening. When I came to learn their churches’ full list of\nexpectations, rules, requirements and sociopolitical policies, I found that I could not\nidentify with this system of spiritual knowing at all. It felt rigid, righteous, unforgiving,\neven angry, and it frightened me. I never anticipated that my culturally enriched,\nintellectually sophisticated sons would be quoting Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell.\n123\nThe Freudian psychoanalyst of my younger days tried to write off these (to me)\ncataclysmic changes as manifestations of male sons’ unconscious oedipal strivings\nto father kill and thus become. After some mulling, my theory did not wash.\nThey spent time accompanying themselves on guitars, singing hymns and\nshouted Corinthian Paulisms to small curious crowds gathered in beach parking\nlots, city parks and inner city street corners of Southern California. They passed out\npamphlets containing New Testament tracts and formulaic aphorisms promising the\npost-repentance blessings of Jesus. The eldest, articulate, bright and prematurely\nworldly, had been an ardent memorizer and appreciator of Shakespeare, especially\nthe mystical Tempest, the music of Aaron Copeland and Igor Stravinsky, the\nimprovisations of Charlie Parker and Cannon Ball Adderley and the provocative\nliterature of the time including Jack Kerouc’s On the Road and Hunter Thompson’s\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas. They loved riffing with the Voltairean pungency of\nFrank Zappa’s lyrics. Now, nihilistic humor had become an anathema.\nSeveral weeks after my eldest son’s transformation, I found him in the\ngarage using a hammer and an empty barrel for disposal as he destroyed his\nmodern jazz and early rock record collection. He ridded himself of all of his fiction\nand most of the nonfiction books in his young but relatively large personal library.\nHis new energy and high purpose emerged as a clearly defined set of rules of\nbehavior, a strong stand against abortion, frequent talk about the need to escape\nfrom the contaminating influence of MTV culture, as well as our years of talk about\nthe biological and physical sciences. Both boys were particularly critical of my\nDarwinian flavored attempts at scientific explanation of man’s inner life using the\nselective and adaptive neurobiology of brain mechanisms and behavior. They spent\nincreasing amounts of time with Church friends, seldom seeing their old ones. The\neldest’s college goals turned from plans for a U.C. Berkeley equipped career in\nliterature and creative writing to a none spiritually challenging, objective and\npractical, Christian free market finance and accounting degree from U.C.’s Business\nSchool.\nGone were shared magical hours of intellectually stimulating, humorous,\neven scholarly discussions. In place of evidential talk in areas of philosophy,\n124\nliterature and science, their opinions and claims derived exclusively from biblical\nquotation. Their particularly favorites were Paul’s letters and some of the later\nprophets, particularly Jesus-auguring Isaiah. “In the beginning was the word…”\nbecame the real reality. The meaning of life was Scripture as explicated by their\nbook church pastors. They scribbled notes in the margins of their Bible pages\nduring sermons They were displeased when I interpreted the wild imagery and 666\nsymbolism of Revelations from the point of view of the historicity of encoded political\nmessages, meanings hidden for the safety of the early Jews in their world of Greco-\nRoman governance. Twenty-five years, before the glut of books by Tim LaHaye, my\nwell-educated sons claimed that Revelations was literal and foretold the coming\ntribulation that augured the end of the world and ascension to heaven of the\nbelievers. My youngest, since childhood a well-read history buff, now viewed New\nTestament scripture as sui generisly, divinely and literally true. They said the\nconduct of their lives their meaning had been clarified by the biblical truths revealed\nto them by The Book. What I did not say was that much of the talk seemed to me to\nbe an intellectually and spiritually impoverished miasma of cant and righteousness.\nAt the same time, their remarkable transformation appeared to be the expression of\na powerful and mystical force, the scientific understanding of which has been the\nostensible focus my life’s work. Why did their alterations appear so alien, strange\nand forbidding?\nBorn to a home of psychoanalytically and scientifically oriented political\nliberals, these precociously bright and worldly sophisticated young men were\nsuddenly transformed into, unrecognizable to me, radical Christian\nFundamentalists. They are now in their late thirties and remain just as ardent,\nChristian patriotic, Right Wing voters to this day. The eldest is now an executive in\nMorris Cerullo’s San Diego based, worldwide missionary movement, raising money\nfor revival and media ministries. He travels to and is involved with hundreds of\nFundamentalist Christian churches in countries ranging from Argentina and Africa to\nthe Middle East and Russia. He hasn’t allow me to contact his children, my\ngrandson and granddaughter, because, in vague talk and mostly silent implication, I\nand people like me are seen as sources of potentially satanic, worldly\n125\ncontamination. He feels wronged by the way I am. He once chided me about what\nhe saw as my futile spiritual search in what he called the “health food” Eastern and\nbrain religions. My youngest, only a little less ardent and critical, visits occasionally,\nand, hands in the air and speaking in tongues, prays to the Lord for my salvation.\nOf course, this sudden and long lasting personal transformation in the\ndirection of Fundamentalism is well known and almost commonplace in modern\nAmerican and European Jewish, Christian and Moslem college educated middle\nclass families. The Saudi Arabian World Trade Center bombers were, mostly, well\nsupported children of the educated middle class We recall the famously tragic\nAmerican radical Moslem, Richard Reid, the would be airplane shoe bomber. My\nstomach clenched as I heard Richard’s sophisticated and obviously caring father\nshare his confusion and struggle to rationalize what had happened to his son. The\ncommonality of this kind of spiritual and life transformations in the educated young\nmakes each event no less painful. On the other hand, we know that healing\ntransformations in the name and spirit of the Christian God can lead to quite positive\nrealities. They are effective in even quasi-secular disguise as in Alcoholics and\nNarcotics Anonymous, Synanon and in the rehabilitation of the Charismatic\nChristian, ex-alcoholic, Southern Methodist politician, George W. Bush.\nPaul Holmer, Professor of Theology at Yale Divinity School gives thanks to\nthe evangelicals who “…keep alive the radical breach that the gospel is from the\nnous of this world…they (Fundamentalists, Evangelicals) look marginal if you are\nchurchy…intolerant if you are ecumenical…anti-intellectual if you are trying to\nsystematize… in their roughness and …abrasiveness.” I bring personal and painful\nwitness to these claims. To get to the personal meaning and mechanisms of these\ntransformations, I had to start from somewhere. I am wedded to the belief of the\nJewish ecstatic, Abraham Abulafia, and not those of Moses Maimonides, that the\nhuman mind in an altered state of activated intellect, man’s Nevesh, can understand\nsuch mystical happenings. I would continue to work at it.\nOne of the early personal church experiences with my sons’ religious path\ncame after accepting an invitation to go with them to a Sunday service at their\ncurrent charismatic church. By then, the eldest was married with children, the\n126\nyoungest, unmarried, was teaching bilingual mathematics in high school. I had\nwaited several years for this occasion.. The meeting took place in a large, gray,\nunmarked warehouse building that was crowded in back with high stacks of storage\ncartons. The large, cement floored, open space in front of the storage boxes was\noccupied by rows of metal folding chairs. They faced an unadorned, elevated\nwooden platform upon which was a lectern and microphone. Behind the lectern\nstood a casual array of a dozen or so young people, singing hymns and playing a\nvariety of instruments. These included piano, two or three guitars and upright bass,\ntenor saxophone, trombone, trumpet, mouth organ and two snare drums. Sounding\na bit like a Salivation Army Band, they played and sang, “They cast their nets in\nGalilee just off the hills of brown; such happy simple fisher folk, before the Lord\ncame down…the peace of God, it is no peace, but strife closed in the sod. Yet let us\npray for but one thing, the marvelous peace of God.”\nThe building, used for commercial storage, packaging and mass mailings\nduring the week and a Charismatic Christian word church on Sunday, was located\nat the rear of an unfinished strip mall. A new and well-polished yellow Cadillac\nDeville was the only vehicle parked in the no parking zone immediately in front of\nthe entrance to the warehouse. My youngest explained that the car belonged to Carl\nAustin, the self-discovered and declared pastor, who spontaneously rose up to lead\nwithout academic religious training or a conventional ordination. The bright yellow\ncar was explained as evidence of the power of God. Paraphrasing Mark, my son\ntold me “…he who does not doubt in his heart and believes that those things he\nsays will come to pass, he will have whatever he says…whatever things you ask for\nwhen you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them.” The car\nserved as a glorious instantiation of the church’s major promise of the rewards of\nfaith.\nPastor Carl Austin, a tall, blonde, portly man in his early thirties with a\nresonant tenor voice, was the youngest of several children of a poor Midwest farm\nfamily. He had been a state college drop out and without a career or a job. His\nsermons contained stories about how he had caught spiritual fire at a revival\nmeeting conducted by Kenneth Hagin of Kenneth Hagin Ministries, aka Rhema\n127\nBible Church, Tulsa, Oklahoma. The pastor’s witness of the Holy Ghost acting\nthrough his life was his personal cure, by transformative Grace, of a triad of selfdestructively\nsinful addictions: alcohol, gambling and promiscuity. Self-chosen and\nself-declared, he now served this two and a half year old growing congregation of\nover 200, mostly young, working families. The young men in attendance at the\nwarehouse church were in shirts and ties, very unlike the more casual garments of\neven dressy occasions in Southern California at that time. Women were dressed\nsimply and modestly. Most of the children were in Sunday school in a small\nneighboring store in the strip mall during the adult service. The few that\naccompanied their parents were remarkably well behaved I was told that most\nfamilies tithed 10% of their income. They quoted Hebrews, “…king of the\nrighteous…to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all….” They believed that\ntheir tithe would be returned manifold and the yellow Cadillac Deville served as\nPastor Carl Austin’s personal evidence. From these funds, the congregation\nsupported the pastor, his car, the rental expenses of the Sunday warehouse church\nand an orphanage in a small Mexican border town. Some of these children, several\nneurologically disabled, were bussed to the Sunday service for healing. They sat\ntogether in a section in the front of the congregation and were the beneficiaries of\nthe second Sunday collection plate, passed around after the first one that was\ndesignated for the church and its pastor.\nThe first Sunday sermon I heard in the warehouse followed several awkward\nminutes of Pastor-directed warm up hugs of neighboring strangers while the choir\nsang hymns. The songs were accompanied by instruments playing the melody in\nunison sans harmony, and accented by the beats of two loud drums. As the volume\nand pace of singing increased, I saw several episodes of ecstatic looks and fainting,\ndying in the Lord and shouts of praise with upraised hands. The intermittent\nelevation of the hands during prayer and song appeared to be spontaneous. I was\ntold that the arms were up as antennae, feeling the energy of Lord all around us.\nThe pastor’s topic was forgiveness. From Ephesians, “…let all bitterness, wrath,\nanger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you, along with all malice… be\nkind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ\n128\nalso forgave you.” In the middle of his sermon, which built slowly in tension and\nvolume, the pastor introduced a forty-ish, sparkly eyed, somewhat overweight, dark\nhaired, slightly made up woman who the Pastor said was a witness for the ultimate\nin Christian forgiveness. She was someone from whom all of us could learn. She\nwas the mother of the 7-year-old boy that he, the Pastor, had, four years before,\naccidentally killed during a drunken driving episode in his “other life.” That was the\none he was living before he was saved. I was told that he presented her in a service\nat least once a year. The woman said that her successful struggle for forgiveness\nled to her being saved. She quoted Ephesians, ”And you who were dead in\ntrespasses and sins hath he quickened.” She looked radiant and hugged the pastor.\nWhen my sons introduced me to him as we filed out at the end of the service, the\npastor told me that my visit was important to the congregation. He told me that Jews\nwere special in Charismatic Christianity since we would play an important role in the\nreturn. He said he hoped he would see more of me. My boys seemed pleased to\nhave invited me.\nI accompanied them to their church most Sundays, and often for what they\ncalled the “rock and role healing services” on Wednesday night, for over two years.\nWithin three or four months I found myself, the first time while awakening out of a\ndeep sleep, mumbling sounds that I was told sounded like some unknown\nlanguage, I was praying in tongues. At some services it happened spontaneously\naccompanied by an almost ecstatic feeling accompanying the surrender of willful\ncontrol. This was usually accompanied by the release of new energy. I recall\nthinking that the spontaneous, nonsensical linguistics shorted out my verbal and\nobsessionally logical left brain allowing the unbridled expression of my hysterical\nright brain. Sometimes in agreement with an insight offered in a sermon or when\nparticularly moved by a hymn, I found my hands lifting skyward, right hand and arm\nhigher than left, with a high feeling of trust and delicious surrender of conscious\ncognitive control.\nReading the New Testament’s Acts, I learned that we were re-enacting the\nscene of the Apostles in the upper room. Those gathered there were the ones\nchosen by the risen Jesus to be able to see Him, the list including Peter, James,\n129\nJohn, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James, Simon and Judas.\n“…they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as\nthe Spirit gave them utterance…” The secular psychoanalyst in me tried to make an\nanalogy with the joyful jazz lyrics of Ella Fitzgerald’s scat singing, I’d done a little of\nthat during my small jazz group pianistics as an a adolescent. I thought about how\nverbally paralyzed stutterers could be articulate when singing what they mean when\nthey could not talk it. I wondered about the relevance of the spontaneous poetry of\nslams and Hip Hop rapping. We attended what my sons called charismatic black\nBaptist churches in South Los Angeles and Long Beach. These often four hour\nservices usually featured two wonderfully harmonic echoing choirs with organ and\ndrum punctuation of the speech-singing, sermonizing Reverend. Large and\nbeautifully dressed black women sang operatically and danced gracefully down the\naisles. I joined my sons in this joyful noise for these long services and, exhausted, I\nwas forced to go home for a Sunday afternoon nap.\nIn spite of what could be regarded as validating experiences with the real life\nHoly Spirit, I continued to be generally confused and even more deeply estranged.\nAn inner voice kept recalling my spiritual failure as a parent and being traitorous to\nmy Jewish ethnic identity by Christian church attendance. I tried to understand how\nmy sons had traveled from where I thought we were living together to this entirely\nnew world. How did it happen? Could the path going there and back be\nmeaningfully reconstructed and then reversed? This idea is consistent with the\nmedical dictum that knowing the cause, the treatment logical follows. My education\nhad shown me such assumptions of reversibility need not be true.\nContrary to the beliefs of early physical mechanics, medical psychiatric\nhistory takers and psychoanalysts reconstructing childhood events, the modern\nphysics and mathematics of complex systems says phase transitions in complex\nsystems are probably not reversible, at least not simply so. One of the features of\nglobal changes in complex systems, often called bifurcations or phase transitions\n(think heated water going suddenly to a boil), is their dramatic discontinuities in\nbehavior. Knowing only the initial and end state, phase transitions in complex\nsystems do not allow for point-to-point backtracking or specific linear-causal\n130\nunderstanding. These discontinuous and global transformations are the stuff of\nmiracles, especially for physicists. Even with respect to initial and end-states, rather\nthan using straight forward phenomenological observation, the mathematical and\nphysical theories of phase transitions are usually dependent on not necessarily\nintuitive, derivative physical quantities. Their verbal representations are often not\nconcrete but metaphoric. This retreat to derived and abstract, far from the primary\ndata computables, may be more evidence of man’s many insufficiencies in\nunderstanding of the mysteries that are often placed in the spiritual realm.\n* * *\nDriven by an effect that contributes to cause, like the faith-driven\nabandonment to God that generates more faith, a drop of water hanging from a\nfaucet is pulled down by its own gravitational field as the thinning neck of the drop\nfacilitates its own further thinning. A gobbet connected by a thick neck to the main\ndrop begins to separate. The neck between them thins and breaks, and one\nbecomes suddenly and irreversibly two. A continuous structure has suddenly\nbecome discontinuous in finite time at what is called a singularity. Since the single\nmeasurable feature that dominates the water’s behavior around this singularity is\nthe diameter of the thinning neck, a derivative physical, one-dimensional\nobservable, neither the details about where it all began (called the initial conditions)\nnor the path it followed to get to the moment of fracture, are predictively relevant\nwith respect to the sudden transition. Considering this kind of phenomenon going on\nin our brains, choosing between theories of behavior that involve changes in brain\ncell groups and/or brain chemicals versus those that involve behavioral quantities,\nmay be neither possible nor necessary. The challenge is to place the problems of\ncataclysmic change in brain and behavior in sufficiently abstract and universal terms\nthat can be represented in some low dimensional, computationally accessible space\nof variables.\nThe simplification and stereotypy of behavior around singularities reduce the\nnumber of features that are required to discuss the dynamics of change in what\n131\nwould otherwise be a complicated beyond reach situation. One of the properties\nfound around singularities, is the loss of absoluteness in contextual characteristics\nsuch as the scale of the observation. We no longer can say that what we are\nstudying happens in inches or miles, in seconds or days, now or in the past. In the\nplace of a single unit of relevant measurement, we have a distribution of spatial and\ntemporal feature sizes that stretch toward both the infinitely small and the infinitely\nlarge.\nWe can illustrate a dynamical transition involving the passage of the system\nthrough a singularity by using the metaphor of another kind of water experiment. If\nwe pour a small amount of water through a filter full of coffee grounds, or watch our\ncoffee maker do it, the first spurt of water makes an incomplete path of wet grounds\nin the bed of dry ones. The next bit of water soaks this path more thoroughly and\nmay form additional and multiple, new and branching, incompletely penetrating\npaths. Eventually, on just one more of these pourings, a connection in the paths\noccur, such that the water snakes all the way through the coffee grounds and the\nfirst brown drop of coffee falls into the pot. At this flow singularity and opposite to\nthe dynamic of a faucet water drop, a discontinuous system of pathways becomes\ncontinuous in finite time in a process called percolation,\nTrying to set up a predictive model, we can count the number of water\ndeliveries that occur before the first drop finds its way through. Repeating the\nexperiment many times yields a span of the number of pours required to reach the\nsingular point of percolation. If we do the experiment enough times, the distribution\nof the number of pours required to reach percolation will range from one toward\ninfinite. In the neighborhood of the transition, time as recorded as the number of\nsmall pouring events may stretch.\nIn aa comparable system, as elegantly described by Detrich Stauffer in his\nSpringer-Verlag book on percolation, multiple hot spots in the woods can suddenly\nfuse into a forest fire. Isaiah said, “…glorify the Lord in the growing fires of dawn…”\nFaith fires spreading through a faithless dense forest, its hot irregular front damped\nby the disbelief of water-filled leaves, or disillusionment gaps of already burned out\ntrees, can, under the right motivating conditions of dryness, wind velocity, tree\n132\ndensity, kindling temperature and desperation-induced willing of faith, sweep\nthrough the entire woods in a sudden blaze. This is the spirit of percolation.\nComputer simulations of percolating blazes generate a multiplicity of life times of\nforest fires near the singularity that represents the transition to a global\nconflagration.\nMentioned previously is Rudolf Otto’s 1917 book about the characteristics of\nreligious experience, Das Heilige, The Sacred, which described phases in the\ndiscontinuous transition from everyday life to the wholly other (ganz andere) reality\nof the world of the sacred. They include intense, numinous experiences of fearsome\nambiguity, dawning awareness of awesome mystery, revelation and appreciation of\nthe majestic power and finally, entrance into a reality of an entirely other place and\ntime than the natural and secular which Mircea Eliade called profane. In his 1958\nbook, Patterns in Comparative Religions, this well-known historian of religion called\nthe revelatory occurrence of sacred reality an hierophany. Eliade’s classic work,\nThe Sacred and the Profane, contrasts the homogenous, spiritually formless and\nrelative world of the profane with the results of passage through spatial and\ntemporal singularities to a place and time that are not of this world.\nPoincaré said that the brain did not know of absolute space, but rather\nestablished a model of it through internal reconstructions of sequential sensory\nexperiences that accompanied our exploratory movements. Activity generates the\ninternalized, partial differential, equations (describing changes in the observable\nwith motions in space) required for representing the dynamical cartography of the\nworld. It was Poincaré’s habit to topologize the dynamics of motion in mathematical\nproblems that lacked analytic solutions. In this way, simple algebraic operations\nreplace some of the insoluble problems of the calculus. Eliade’s sacred space\ndefining singularity in the plane that breaks profane homogeneousness, a center\npoint that is no longer a circle, can be viewed also as Poincaré’s topological center.\nHis topological brain theory found expression in the formal representation of internal\nspace as the invariant product of an organism’s displacement groups of imagined or\nreal physical movements around such singular fixed points. The operational object\ncalled groups defines this kind of algebraic, mathematical structure and motion.\n133\n\nassociated with the loss of habitual temporal-spatial contextual moorings. A mind at\ntime one and the same mind at time two are unconnected. They are wholly other.\nIn much the same sense, for Eliade, sacred time, like space, is neither\nhomogenous nor linearly continuous. Sacred time is circular, recoverable and\nreversible. Past, primordial, mythical time can exist in the present. Religious\nfestivals are recurrently ontological, allowing the recovery of the sacred time such\nthat their past and present expressions are the same. Rebirth is new birth. In the\nlanguage of the North American Indian Tribe, the Yokuts, the term for world\n(cosmos) and year are the same. A year and the world has gone by, only to start\nagain. The Dakota Tribe says that the Year goes around the World. As Elaide has\nsaid, “…at each New Year…the world (is) recreated and to do this is also to create\ntime…the sick man becomes well because he begins life again with its sum of the\nenergy intact.” Healing by becoming another or renewed self may become a frontier\nscience in the yet unexplored field of phase transition medicine.\nThe quality of separateness, discontinuity in states, as occurs in the samedifferent\ninside world, is much like that found in the stages of anesthesia. Each\nstage of anesthesia is ganz andere from the others. In Stage I anesthesia, fast\nfrequency, low voltage brain waves are observed and accompanied by a two\nMartini-like, mildly activated, sedated but exhilarated high. Stage II, the next deeper\nstage of anesthesia, is marked by the sudden emergence of intermittent bursts of\nhigh amplitude brain waves, and animals and man demonstrate bizarre postures,\nhallucinatory phenomena, fixed staring, and sometimes movements that look like\nacting out some symbolic drama. This stage marks the beginnings of the loss of\nresponsiveness to painful stimuli. In the sudden drop into Stage III, a low voltage\nmix of mostly slow and some fast brain waves can be seen associated with\ndepressed consciousness, complete insensitivity to pain, slow regular respiration\nand an unexcitable cardiovascular system. Stage IV is the deepest stage of\nanesthesia. This state is characterized by very low voltage, almost flat brain waves,\na loss of spontaneous breathing, the collapse of blood pressure and, finally, cardiac\nirregularities and death in cardiac arrest. These are both discontinuous and global\nbrain state phase transitions.\n135\n\n\nprimary process by Freud and his followers. This forgotten language of the\nunconscious, an archaic needs and fear-driven tongue lurking beneath our\nsupposedly objective discourse, comes to dominate themes of communication in\nthe middle of these unfinished spiritual transitions. The Rorschach Test of master\nmeditaters and LSD users overflow with conflictual primary process images, as\ndoes the talk of patients on the verge of schizophrenic decompensation. The\nprimitive symbolism of primary process provides the major current in the overwritten\nprose of the hyper-religious temporal lobe limbic epileptics described previously and\ncalled the Geschwind Syndrome and in the regressed and iconic transference\nconcerns of patients with tendencies for global and sudden phase transitions,\nprostitute to saint, righteous obsessional to conscienceless psychopath, called\nborderline personality disorder.\nPrimary process represents a dynamical brain state, one unburdened by\nlinearly predictive connections with reality. It is a state without even a transient\nsingle defining physical time or other fixed measure of order. It is without the causal\nlogic or knowledge of an outside reality that a brain implies in supposing to know. Its\nprimitively instinctual style and goals contrast with more physically time-locked,\nreality oriented thinking which Freud called secondary process and Penn-Lewis\nreferred to as ordinary and religiously lawful “reasoning faculties.”\nAn absence of absolute time and space scales with which the executive ego\norders internal and external time and events, and therefore their relations, results in\nprimary process thinking characterized by condensations of several, often\nincompatible, representations into one. Dueling, conflictual and simultaneous\nfeelings and thoughts float from their relevant objects to others. In the transitional\ntranscendent state, there may be confusion of self with others, of objects with their\nlabels, of parts with the whole and of symbols with the things that they symbolize.\nThis facilitates living in the spirits of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost at the\nsame time. Mixed inextricably with saintly awareness and charisma, there are\nsignatures of instinctually driven and configured primary process. Freud’s classical\nwork on slips of the tongue concerned the intrusion of these instinctual thought\nstream condensations from the world of the ganz andere and displacements into\n138\neveryday life. In this intense and quasi-fluid state, saintly priests slip seamlessly into\nsexual predation; an ecstatic Jewish Orthodox fundamentalist shoots 29 praying\nMoslems in a cave near Abraham’s burial plot for Sarah in Hebron; what were\nlovingly mystical, Jelaluddin Rumi’s Afghanistan (Balkh) descendents become\npeople bashing and women stoning morality police; committed and mesmerizing\nChristian televangelists attend peep shows and seek child pornography; devoted\nIslamists crash airplanes into tall New York buildings.\nIn the physics of condensed matter, two common forms of multi-molecular or\npolyatomic cooperative arrangements are the crystalline condition and in some\nways its opposite, the amorphous glassy state that results from rapid cooling\nthrough a melting temperature. The microscopic atomic arrangement in glasses, in\ncontrast with the crystalline state, exhibits no spatial periodicity or long-range order.\nIn contrast with fluids, the friction of passage of molecular elements of glasses past\neach other, their shear viscosity, is large enough such that their macroscopic\nshapes are maintained in the very slow flow for very long times. In-between the\ncrystalline and glassy states their exists a multiplicity of possible unstable\narrangements which result from what physicists call frustration, the inability of a\nsystem to find a unique, lowest energy, ground state. The generic example of a\nferromagnetic crystal has two types of ordering principles: (1) The mutual alignment\nof the atomic magnetic moments, visualizable as the lining up of dipole, positive to\nnegative, magnetic arrows; (2) The geometric crystalline low energy ground state\ndescribed above.\nWhen the symmetry of these two ordering principles are incompatible,\nimagine an arrangement of neighboring atoms that prefer anti-alignment of the\nmagnetic moments which are placed on a geometrically triangular rather than a\nsquare lattice, there is no single arrangement that can satisfy both magnetic and\ngeometric principles. What emerges in this state of frustration is the potential for a\nmultiplicity of nearly equal energy states. Water has the potential for both geometric\nice crystal symmetry as well as arrangements of hydrogen proton (+) to oxygen\nelectron (-) magnetic moments (with well-ordered oxygen lattices but disorder\namong the hydrogen positions). It is therefore not surprising that a multiplicity of\n139\n\nindirectly by my sons and church elders about joining a study group for personal\nconversion.\nI was surprised to learn that discussions of current political topics were a\nregular part of these discussions as well as the Sunday and Wednesday night\nservices. We received a weekly political action committee report. Their issues\ninvolved abortion, school vouchers, sex education in schools, family planning,\nschool prayer and carefully chosen Christian elected officials for school boards and\nthe Congress. As a congregation, we frequently held hands in small circles and\nprayed for the electoral success of our issues and candidates. Twenty years later,\nthis movement has evolved into the public political morality play of the Republican\nbase of George W. Bush.\nLaying on of hands, dying in the Lord, speaking in tongues, dancing in the\naisles and praying with up stretched arms were routine in the hymn dense services.\nThe goal for all was the spiritual transformation of mind as in Romans, “…be not\nfashioned according to this world, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your\nmind that ye may prove what is the good and well-pleasing and perfect will of\nGod…” The pastor told us that the world ruled mind could not grasp spiritual things\nas in Corinthians “…they are foolishness unto him and he cannot know them,\nbecause they are spiritually understood.”\nMy research took me to a collaborative project at a European mathematics\ninstitute for three months. I returned to our town very late on a Saturday night. I\nplanned to surprise my sons by appearing at their usual choice of the middle service\nthe next day. I drove up to the warehouse church fifteen minutes before the service\nwas scheduled and found that the parking lot of the strip mall was nearly empty.\nThere was no Cadillac parked at the front door. I banged on the double door when I\nfound it locked. More then a little surprised, I called my eldest. He told me that four\nweeks before, the pastor disappeared, I later found that his disappearance\naccompanied that of the congregation’s bank account, and no one knew where he\nhad gone. He had not warned or informed anyone in the congregation about his\nplans. Calmly and without apparent awareness of my surprise and distress, my\n141\neldest asked me if I would like to attend the late Sunday morning service at their\nnewly chosen Charismatic Christian church. He gave me its address and told me\nthat the service started at 11:00 AM. There still was enough time for us to meet\nthere. I wondered how the Pastor Carl Austin would use this incident in sermons\nabout sin and redemption to his next congregation.\nFurther Readings for Pentecostal Phase Transitions\nReligious and Spiritual Groups in Modern America.

In these sacerdotaly rigid and\nfaithful, disenfranchisement and righteous intolerance toward other denominations\nare simultaneous with spiritual compassion, mercy and forgiveness for the members\nof their own. This splitting between the good people and latent evil doers is seen by\npsychoanalysts and dynamically oriented brain scientists as an all too common,\nsometimes psychopathological, solution to the inevitable ambiguities of living. I am\ncertainly not alone in being fearful of Fundamentalists: Jewish, Christian, Moslem\nand Hindu. From the overpass above the freeway, bearded Jewish Orthodox men\nrained rocks onto the roof of my rented car because I was driving on Sabbath. A\nresearch project had taken me to Jerusalem Mental Health Center’s neurochemical\nlaboratories for collaborative work with mostly secular Jewish scientists. Halachic\nconsiderations, those of Jewish lawfulness, comparable to the constraints of Muslim\nshirah, forbids working, even driving, on the Sabbath. Orthodox Jews live walking\ndistance from synagogues or benefit from a rabbinicaly blessed, network of\nsymbolically covered walkways for going longer distances on the Sabbath. This\n144\nSabbarian grid of permission obviously did not cover driving on the free way to the\nmental health center.\nIt is the splitting of us from them that leads to the breakdown in empathy and\ncompassionate identification with others. Studies of the dominance of direction of\nrotation within a closed space in small mammals have shown that amphetamineinduced\nintensification makes the choice of right versus left (or left versus right)\nrotation, broken symmetry, more statistically significant. In contrast, the Hefner\nFoundation of Switzerland has shown that entheogenic drugs such as psilocybin in\nman facilitate seeing both of the conflicting, simultaneously presented, right eye and\nleft eye images in place of the usual dominance of just one of the two\nrepresentations. A precondition of compassion might be that a person’s brain be\nable to see and comprehend both or several sides of apparently conflicting points of\nview at the same time. The Fundamentalists do not see things that way. In the\nKoran, Mohammed says, “…give sustenance to the poor man, the orphan, the\ncaptive…and for the unbelievers We have prepared fetters and chains and a\nblazing fire….” In the New Testament’s Mark we find the final words of the risen\nJesus, “…whoever believes and is baptized will be saved but whoever does not\nbelieve will be damned.” The Crusaders’ claimed scriptural support for their\nmurderous marches to reclaim Jerusalem.\nCarl Jung wrote about the New Testament’s Revelations in his Answer to\nJob: “…a terrifying picture that blatantly contradicts all ideas of Christian humility,\ntolerance, love of your neighbor and your enemies and makes nonsense of a loving\nfather in heaven and rescuer of mankind. A veritable orgy of hatred, wrath,\nvindictiveness and blind destructive fury that revels in fantastic images of terror\nbreaks out…overwhelming a world which Christ endeavored to restore to the\noriginal state of innocence and loving communion with God…” As Princeton\nUniversity philosopher, Walter Kaufman, has noted in his Religion in Four\nDimensions “…compassion for unbelievers is implicitly condemned and\nproscribed…Augustine argued expressly against compassion for the damned and\nLuther used invectives against his (religious) enemies…” How can this be God’s\n145\nsetting for the spiritual work toward that promised in John “…that you love one\nanother; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.”\nIn contrast with what has been described in previous chapters as the\nentheogenic drug-induced transitions to a spiritual mind, one is tempted to describe\nthese Fundamentalists’ states as the amphetamine religions. The Los Angeles\nRam’s Hall of Fame defensive end, on very high doses of amphetamine (125\nmilligrams compared with the diet dose of 5 milligrams) taken four hours before the\nSunday games, the Baptist minister, Deacon Jones, used his famous and\nconsciousness annihilating head slap to daze the opposing offensive tackle in order\nto gain access to and injure the other team’s quarterback. Before taking the handful\nof Dexedrine spansuls, he would tell me, “See you on Tuesday.” Along with the\nDeacon’s destructive aggression was the other invariant feature of the actions of\nhigh doses of amphetamine, compulsive stereotypy, the fixity and driven repetition\nof over simplified actions and thoughts along with the loss of breadth of vision and\nadaptive flexibility. Deacon consistently rushed inside, took the inside lane, in spite\nof offensive linemen, who having studied previous game films, being set up to\nexpect his route. They used this knowledge to take him out of the play. In modern\ntheological parlance, judgmental rigidity and thinly veiled disapproval take the place\nof the more flexibly curious and lovingly humane feelings of the participants in the\nevolution in spiritual understanding of today’s liberal Protestant process religions.\nThese are the ones that believe that the properties of God evolve along with our\nbiology, our brains and our growing scientific understanding of ourselves and the\nworld.\nAngry splitting is not just a stimulant drug effect. Recall my experience of the\nsudden emergence of a first second wind after a mile or so of my daily ten miles of\nrunning. It was frequently accompanied by inner bursts of obsessive, paranoid\nthoughts. Taking five milligrams of amphetamine felt much like the first second\nwind. I am full of energy with arrogant feelings of power, mind fixated in grand and\nsimple ideas that I believe to be absolute and correct. I feel irritably intolerant about\nanyone or anything different. It is my virtuous duty to set everyone straight.\n146\nIn the 1980’s, Moishe Zar, a desert castle dwelling, settlement organizing,\nardent Orthodox Jewish Zionist, now 65 years old, was the leading vigilante of the\nWest Bank He planted bombs in the cars of Arab mayors and plotted to blow up the\nDome of the Rock. Buying up farmland from the Palestinians beginning in 1979,\nmany of whom were then killed by their own because they were seen as\ncollaborators, Zar and his group of young volunteer settlers took over harvesting the\nPalestinian’s olive trees and shooting rifles over the heads of those that would take\nthem back. Fundamentalist Christians share his vision that the coming of the\nMessiah, the second for Christians, the first for the Jews, is dependent upon the\ncomplete return of all of the land of Israel to the Jews.\nI recall that in the middle 1940’s, my father took me to a fund raising dinner\nfor the local chapter of the Jewish Antidefamation League. The whispered talk was\nabout blowing up a warehouse in which anti-Semitic pamphlets were stored,\nplanned for the middle of the night when it was unoccupied. Even at the age of 10, I\ncould tell that their quiet anger and firm commitment made these threatened men\nfeel less vulnerable. I understood a little more about the motivation for this proposed\nnighttime property destruction when, the following year, my father explained the\nreason for our being refused overnight rooms at several motels as we drove along I-\n95 in Southeast Florida. It took us until late night to find a place to sleep. This was\nAmerica’s muted version of what Hitler and his legions were doing to Jews that, at\nthat time, was not generally known, except for Walter Winchell, in America.\nResonant with our chemical-cultural theme are the many reports that Hitler was\ntaking an amphetamine drug, Benzedrine, daily and in high doses for the last 20 or\nmore years of his life. One can hear the characteristic, amphetamine-induced,\nhigher pitched, rants in his recorded radio tirades. Compare the pitch and strained\nvoice quality of the singing of Bob Dylan in his early records made while he was on\nspeed with the gravely, much lower pitched voice, now that he is not. In our\nbehavioral neuropharmacology laboratory at the Brain Research Institute at UCLA,\nProfessor Charles Spooner and I used an audiographic oscilloscope to monitor the\nsounds of baby chicks whose peeps became higher in pitch and rate following\ninjections of amphetamine. The earliest members of the methadrine-amphetamine\n147\nchemical family were synthesized by the great organic chemists of the German\npharmaceutical industry in the early 1930’s.\nThe sequence of parallel streets in the neighborhood of my home and first\ngrammar school in Kansas City, Missouri were my street, Virginia, then Tracy,\nForrest and Troost. My school, Bancroft Elementary, was on Tracy and one block\ndown that street was the Lutheran Day School established by German immigrants\nunder the aegis of the Missouri Synod. Starting in the third grade in 1943, I was\nintermittently and unpredictably chased by rock throwing, “damn Jew” and “Christ\nkiller” shouting boys from the Lutheran Day School. I had my choice of running for\nsafety directly from Tracy to my family’s half duplex at 4232 Virginia Street, or\nmoving away from school via Troost and then down several blocks and around to\nsneak back to my home on Virginia without being spotted. One run-for-it afternoon,\nmy parents took me to the emergency room of the Menorah Hospital to have my\nscalp sewed up where a sharp rock had landed.\nWhen I asked my synagogue’s young people’s spiritual counselor, Rabbi\nKleigfeld, to explain the feelings and actions of these children of Martin Luther’s\nPost-Reformation Christian Church, he answered that I already knew about similarly\ndifficult places and times of our Twelve Tribes’ like Rome, Medieval Europe, the\nSpanish Inquisition, Persia (Iran) and, it was rumored, in Germany as we spoke.\n“Conversion or death” was its most benign form, in places like Spain and Iran, many\nJews faked it, staying alive and practicing Judaism secretly. Kleigfeld told me that\nthe causes of this historical theme of persecution of Jews were complex.\nAmong the frequently unmentioned events recorded in the later part of the\nworldly life of Mohammed, who lived from 570 to 632 AD was, ”…in the name of\nAllah, the Compassionate, the Merciful…” his participation in the crushing of the\nJewish tribe of al-Nadhir in 626 A.D., the beheading of 800 Jewish men of the tribe\nof Qurayza who refused to accept Allah as their God in 627 A.D. and putting to the\nsword the Jews of Khaybar in 629 A.D. As in the section of the Koran called The\nCow, Mohammed proposed to “…fight against them (the infidels) until idolatry is no\nmore and Allah’s religions reigns supreme…” In contrast, the more entheogenic\nspiritual orientation of the ecstatic followers of Mohammed in his earlier years\n148\nspeaks of the multiplicity of valid Ways to Deep Truth. The acceptability of many\nways is supported in the tales from the millennial oral tradition of the Sufi Masters in\ntheir Teaching Stories. One of them, What Befell the Three, is attributed to the early\n18 th Century Sufi teacher, the Dervish Murad Shami. In it, an apparition is mobilized\nby the concentrated Truth seeking efforts of three Sufi Dervishes named Yak, one,\nDo, two and Se, three. When this “…white smoke head of the very old man…” was\nasked what he was, he answered “…I am what you think me to be…have you never\nheard the saying ‘There are as many ways to the Deep Truth as there hearts of\nman.’” In the narratives about the lives of the Mevlevi Islam dervishes called\nMunaquib el-Arafin (1353), Jalaludin Rumi, the Sufi saint, instructs his ill and\ntroubled petitioner to ask forgiveness from the Christian he recently spat on saying\n“…whether a ruby or a pebble, there is a place on His hill, there is a place for all…”\nCole Barks and Michael Green’s The Illuminated Prayer (2000) notes that the Rumi\nfollower, Bawa Muhaiyaddeen, a modern Sufi guru, was said to be keenly aware\nhow quickly spiritual entheogenic systems can become amphetamine-like and\n“…develop rigid marching orders …which turn into a dumb obsession with other\npeople’s behavior…”\nIt appears that entheogenic and amphetamine spiritualities can coexist\ncontemporaneously, in Islam as well as in all the other of the world’s great religions.\nOne day, sneaking home from school, taking the long way around via Troost,\nI was spotted and chased up some stairs into an apartment building’s dark hall.\nTerrified, I swung hard and hit the leading angry and noisy head with a propitiously\nfound snow shovel that had been left near the apartment’s entrance. An ambulance\nwas called to tend to the twelve-year-old, transiently unconscious, Lutheran boy. He\nrecovered completely within a day and the chases after school and my desperate\nescapes stopped suddenly, never to reappear. After several months, our family\ncrossed the socioeconomic divide in Kansas City to a more tolerant, upper middle\nclass, Southside neighborhood near Rockhill Road, to a suburban home, one block\nfrom Missouri’s border with Kansas. There, persecution for my Jewishness took\nmore subtle forms such as not being permitted to play teen-age golf with my friends,\nthough invited, on their Blue Hills and Kansas City Country Club’s golf courses. It\n149\nwas decades later that the first Jewish member of the KCCC was the founder of H\nand R Block. Unable to afford membership in the single all Jewish country club of\nthe region, I practiced for my high school golf team on Armour Hills Public Golf\nCourse, where, at the time, mostly white working class golfers played.\nHow can it be that spiritual states include both personal humbleness and\nloving mercy toward some of mankind and judgmentalness, nonacceptance and\ncommitment to seduction, threat and even violence in the service of invoking\nchanges in the beliefs of others. How can the high energy calm of being home at\nlast in the born again condition with its new freedom from self assaults about sin,\nmost importantly that of disbelief, but also peccadilloes such as drunkenness,\npromiscuity and familial abuse, be associated with readiness to judge, harass even\npersecute others. Psychoanalysts would say that it is a riddance mechanism, the\nprojection of unwanted personal traits onto others. From the standpoint of rational\nthought, this seems more like non-Aristotelian cognition, two, not either-or,\ncountervailing orientations toward mankind held simultaneously. The newborn\nparishioners of these charismatic amphetamine churches express their fealty to\nGod with strongly held beliefs that diagram logically as contradictions. The\nperception of the world’s peoples into believers and infidels, good and evil, our\npeople and your people, ourselves and the others. It is generally believed among\nsocial psychologists that it is the perceived nonpersonness of others, which allows\nthe cruelty that empathic identification with them would never permit. Splitting feels\nlike resolution, its stereotypy reducing the complexity of spiritual thought as well as\ntrue to life perception.\nA concrete laboratory example of amphetamine conversion, the sudden\ntransition to a high energy, fixated, and delusional state called amphetamine\npsychosis, is supplied by experiments in humans conducted by Professor John\nGriffith at Vanderbilt University in the 1960’s. These experiments would not be\nallowed by today’s human research committees or medical ethicists. Each one of a\ngroup of psychologically screened-as-normal graduate student volunteers, at an\nindividually unique amphetamine dose, developed suddenly a personally unique\nand peculiar system of new beliefs, obsessionally held as rational thoughts. Ten\n150\nmilligrams of amphetamine were administered to volunteer subjects every hour until\nevery subject crossed their particular threshold for personality change. The\ngraduate students underwent a global mind-brain-person transition at differing total\ndoses of amphetamine. The subject’s world was suddenly transformed into one of\nenemies and friends. The syndrome dissipated over several hours when the drug\nwas stopped and the plasma levels of amphetamine and its metabolites declined.\nAs amphetamine makes memory formation and recall stronger, the subjects were\nembarrassed when remembering what strange and forbidding yet uneatable things\nthey so strongly believed. These included such things as: they as good people were\ncaught in a network of bad person Russian spies; some threatening others arranged\nfor poison gas to be seeping out of the water faucet; the white coated scientists\nwere CIA undercover intelligence officers hoping to get information about their small\npornography collection. The subject’s world had become divided in, for each\nperson, a stereotyped way.\nAfter a couple of weeks of return to normal living, the experiment was\nrepeated. Each subject again developed his or her individually unique set of goodguy,\nbad-guy delusional beliefs and at the same dose of amphetamine as before.\nLike those of strong faith, their ideas once again resisted the logical arguments\nmade by the professional staff: that the new realities were neuropsychological and\nhad an obvious pharmacological origin. While on the drug, all stuck to their story,\neven while being shown the movie record of their first drug-induced episode. There\nis reliable scientific literature describing kamikaze pilots on high doses of\namphetamine in an ecstatic state of Shinto nationalism. With their planes loaded\nwith explosives, they deliberately crashed their planes onto American aircraft\ncarriers in the Pacific Theater of World War II. One wonders if these drug-induced\nstates occur in the drug-free condition in today’s abstemious Muslim suicide\nbombers.\nA more abstract and general way of thinking about the sudden emergence of\nfixation, repetitiousness and splitting in feelings and thoughts involves the\nemergence of regular limit cycle oscillations in a complex system that was behaving\npreviously in a stable but flexible way. Locking up into a fixed, closed loop, is a\n151\ncommon way for electrical circuits, computer programs, brain mechanisms and\nother complicated systems, even cultural or spiritual movements, to behave when\none or more important control parameters crosses a threshold. Doyne Farmer of the\nLos Alamos’s Prediction Company once said about this vulnerability in complex\nsystem, “Those things can hardly wait to roll up.” The limit cycle lock-up occurs\nmost often as a sudden, discontinuous change, called a bifurcation, into\nautonomous self-oscillations from an equilibrium state around which there was\nsome random variation. A bifurcation, a discontinuous change in outcome from a\nsmooth changes cause, characteristically occurs when the amount of an important\ninfluence, a metabolic state, a drug, a psychodynamic conflict or level of emotional\nstimulation crosses some critical value. The switch from one type of dynamical\nbehavior to another looks like the system has suddenly changed into something\nelse with an entirely new kind of life of its own. In the new life of rolled up, locked-up\nrepetitious motion, almost all new starting conditions follow pathways that lead into\nthe same limit cycle pattern. Evangelical Christians talk about all born again life\nbeing in Jesus, fixed in a complete set of moral, social and political beliefs, ideas\nand judgments. The limit cycle gets its name because the end state of the orbits of\nalmost all starting points of the dynamics winds up being drawn into the same fixed,\nrepetitious pattern of a stable cycle. Visualizing the simulation of one kind of\nbifurcation to a limit cycle on a computer screen, we see a slightly jiggling point\nexplode suddenly into an orbit of ceaseless rotations around a circle.\nRalph Abraham, the University of California at Santa Cruz pioneer in\ngraphical approaches to nonlinear systems, describes, cinemagraphically, the\nemergence of limit cycles from a single point. He starts with a picture of an attractor\nof water flow in the shape of a basin. All water that enters the basin, rolls down its\nsides to the bottom, to what physicists say represents a potential energy minimum.\nA little more technically, this attractor basin is composed of the set of all points such\nthat the orbits that flow from them tend to end up inside the basin as time goes\ntoward infinity, no matter where they start. Changing the value of a control\nparameter of the system changes the shape of this basin-like landscape, of the\nsurface of the systems dynamical actions called a manifold, which can intuitively\n152\npredict how the fluid will flow upon it. If we start with a simple bowl, a parabolic\nbasin, then the attractor itself is a point at the bowl’s very bottom. Changing the\nvalue of some influential parameter may induce the sudden formation of a small hill,\ngrowing at the center of the basin’s bottom. Now fluid flow in the attractor bowl runs\ndown to a path around the hill at its bottom. The autonomous motion of the fluid\nflows takes place now in a circular orbit. The basin of the new attractor is the\noriginal bowl minus the point at the top of the central hill. The fluid flow around the\nhill at the bottom of the basin is circular and is called a limit cycle. Note that the\ndirection of the rotation of the limit cycle can circle in one direction or the other. In\nsome computational simulations, motion alternates between directions. This\nsuggests the aspect of the born again amphetamine religions, splitting. There is an\nunstable and intermixed probability of right versus left turning directions and their\nalternation. This vulnerability to directional splitting and often unpredictable\nalterations in action themes can represent what seem to be paradoxical\ncombinations of both good and evil in the same strongly faithful, for example, the\napparent bidirectional morality of generous and loving, pederast priests.\nThese mathematically flavored images of the sudden emergence of a limit\ncycle in complex systems was made biologically concrete to me by research\nconducted by one of my first graduate students, David Segal. He is now a professor\nof psychiatry at the University of California in San Diego. His program of work\ninvolved the administration of very gradually increasing doses of amphetamine to\nrats while their behavior was being monitored and recorded by a continuously\nrunning video camera. He documented the behavior of rats in a walled rectangular\nspace within which, without drugs, they first wandered about randomly and then\nsettled down to rest in an individually selected, favorite home corner. Segal called\nall of these phenomena, patterns of exploratory behavior. At doses of amphetamine\nbelow 2.5 milligrams (mg) per kilogram weight (kg), the exploration of the entire\nbounded space proceeded faster than was the case with their salt-water treated\ncontrols, their paths being more uniformly distributed throughout the box. They\nspent less time resting in their home corner. At almost precisely 2.5 mg/kg, the rat’s\nbehavior changed dramatically into an entirely new pattern of continuous circling. As\n153\nwas the case in the abstract manifold picture of bifurcations to limit cycles, some\nrats tended to circle their chamber to the left and some to the right and switching\nbetween them was often seen.\nThe influence of amphetamine and other brain dopamine neurotransmittermediated\ndrug manipulations on directional turning tendencies in rats, mice and\ncats were the focus of brain and behavioral research of Professor Stanley Glick of\nthe University of Massachusetts. The asymmetry of dopamine concentrations in the\ntwo sides of the brain, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex and the brain\nstem’s nucleus accumbens, predicted both the paw preference for pellet reaching\nand direction of turning in several studies in rats. These findings were statistically\ntrue over a population of rats, but not necessarily predictive for any single one.\nReminiscent of the conflict between good and evil in our human spiritual analogy,\nnaturally right turning male rats and left turning female rats, when compared with\nthe opposite paired group, were greater voluntary ingesters of alcohol placed in\ntheir water bottles.\nSplitting as a part of the phenomenology of limit cycle bifurcations, with\ndirectional implications for good and evil, has neurological support in humans as\nwell. In the context of contrasting right versus left hemispheric temporal lobe\nsyndromes, recall that temporal lobe seizures with a right side excitatory focus\nleads to the development of the Geshwind Syndrome, a high, softly energetic and\nsaintly state of spiritual preoccupation and voluminous writings, loving and generous\nkindness toward all and the complete disappearance of sexual interest but not\nsexual potency. A left temporal lobe excitatory focus leads to the development of\nthe Kluver-Bucy Syndrome of indiscriminate aggressiveness and hypersexuality.\nExperimental simulations of this syndrome in cats lead to them mounting and\nattacking living and nonliving things, even chairs. A variety of manipulations of the\nsymmetry of brain dopamine concentration and dynamics by its characteristic drug,\namphetamine, interact with lateral brain lesions such that we conclude that the\nstimulant-induced limit cycle lockup remains a phenomena influenced by drugs, sex,\ngenetic predisposition and several other experimental conditions. This situation is\n154\nperhaps not so different in variety and complexity from the range of representations\nin art and literature of the left hand of evil and the right hand of grace.\nOscillations that appear spontaneously in nonlinear systems without external\nperiodic input were known to Henri Poincaré in 1882, and were systematically\nstudied and made accessible to non-mathematicians by early 20 th Century Russian\nmathematicians and physicists, well represented by a 1949 book, Theory of\nOscillations by the Russian engineer-mathematicians, A. A. Andropov and C.E.\nChaikin. Another relatively early classic is Nonlinear Oscillations by Nicholas\nMinorsky. The most common form of transition from a fixed point to a limit cycle was\npictured as changes in the surface of the action, the bowl-hillock manifold in the\nparagraphs above, and is called a Hopf bifurcation. Recall that bifurcation means a\ndiscontinuous change in an observable over a continuous change in what is known\nas a control parameter, such as dose of amphetamine or intensity of an experience.\nThe mathematical mechanism resulting in circular directional motion represented by\nthe (eigen)vectorial states, was named for the German mathematician, Eduard\nHopf. His 1942 paper was a mathematical proof of its existence and was discussed\nin the context of fluid flows that role up such that circling vortices arise from smooth,\ncalled laminar, water flow, at a critical value of the flow rate. Hurricanes are another\nexample of these kinds of dynamics.\nThe Hopf bifurcation to limit cycles has been found in several, many\ndimensional, physical, chemical and biological systems. The latter include calcium\nconductance oscillations in the excitable membranes of muscle, heart and the brain,\ncardiac arrhythmias such as ventricular flutter as well as oscillations in population\nnumbers in foxes and rabbits, predator-prey systems. California Institute of\nTechnology’s Professor, James Old and Johns Hopkins Professor, Joseph Brady\nmade experimentally obvious the potential for the rigid irrationality implied by the\nbrain’s inclination to be locked up into limit cycle behavior. They demonstrated that\nanimals, from rats to monkeys, could get locked up in apparent self torture,\nrepeatedly and endlessly pushing a bar to deliver current to pain systems in the\ntheir brains. These pushes induced almost unremitting screams in monkeys and\n155\nwhat appeared to be rageful biting and then immobilized resignation in behaviorally\ndepressed rats.\nFreud’s last paper, Analysis, Terminable and Interminable (1939), featured\nexamples of what he perceived to be the unsolvable mystery of helpless\npsychological entrapment in repetitious patterns of self-destructive behavior. He\nblamed the Iliad’s and Odyssey’s villainous immortal, Thanatos, the everthreatening\nspirit of death and destruction to contrast with the good, life giving Eros.\nThe Yiddish word for a personified Thanatos is Moloch ha-Moves. A range of\nfixations in self-excitatory, repetitious, self-mutilating behaviors is documented in\ndomesticated animals. Dogs, particularly German Shepherds and Labrador\nRetrievers, can lock up in compulsive grooming cycles of what is called acral lick in\nwhich endless licking of paws or flanks lead to the break down of skin into seepingsore\ndermatitis, which, in turn, stimulates more licking.\nMark Twain wrote a story about his getting stuck in ceaseless mental\nrepetitions of a catchy, clangy poem. He could not stop reciting it to himself even\nafter days of sleep loss and anorexia. He was finally cured by relating his problem\nand the poem to his pastor who he then unwittingly heard creating a community\nepidemic by including the rhyme in his following Sunday’s sermon. Psychologists,\nwho study this form of human mental limit cycle attacks, call this state of internal,\nrepetitiously recited, poetic stuckness, earworms.\nThere are additional invariants of sudden transformations into spiritual-mindbrain\nbifurcations into a limit cycle lockups and, as discussed, one of them is\npsychological splitting. In psychoanalytic theory, as first suggested by Freud in his\n1937 written and posthumously published paper, Splitting of the Ego in the Process\nof Defense (1940), splitting implies two simultaneous and contrary psychological\nreactions, one can be conscious and the other unconscious. They can both emerge\nin conflictual situations involving adaptive efforts of the personality to deal with the\nopposition between some form of powerful instinctual pressure and attendant\nperceived or imagined danger. Otto Fenichel’s Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis\n(1950) elucidates multiple manifestations of splitting of the I (more technically, the\nego) into a conscious part that knows reality versus an unconscious part that denies\n156\nit. In some situations, a logical view contends with a more irrational, magical one.\nToday, the morning group praying, evening hymn singing, Christian Republican\nRight Wing feed their feelings of being on the side of God by dividing people into\nthose that are like them and good and those that President Bush and Attorney\nGeneral John Ashcroft calls the evil doing “bad guys.” As noted previously,\npsychoanalytic theory posits that the evil doing others may represent the projected\nrepository of our own unacceptable impulses and inclinations. It became quite clear\nin my own psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic training that it is in healing our split\nand knowledge of our own unacceptable things that will lead to our understanding\nand forgiveness of others.\nAs we dig deeper into global brain-mind dynamics of emergent high-energy\nfixation, stuck repetitiousness and splitting, we encounter their universality in the\nstructures of mathematical thought. Did we just make them fit? Do these thought\nforms map onto internal and external physical reality? Are these abstract concepts\nand operations simply products of our biological brains manifested as psychological\nmechanics and used to explain to ourselves what we perceive and think? Does a\nsquare have external reality or is it a universally imagined something, and, as such,\nrepresented only in our minds and the pictures of it we draw? Is mathematical\nunderstanding simply inborn perceptual skills combined with developed and\npracticed logical cognition? Or, do we take the Platonic view of mathematical\nrelations: these abstractions are the ultimate realities, antedating and persisting\nthrough the past, present and future of the universe and omnipresent.\nWhere can the conceptual boundary be drawn between the physical reality of\nthe Babylonian surveyors use of the Pythagorean theorem to calculate distances,\nthat the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle is equal\nto the square of the length of its hypotenuse, and its abstract, pencil-marks-onpaper,\nalgebraic development as in the definition of Pythagorean numbers, a,b, and\nc such that a 2 + b 2 = c 2 . The dichotomy between the abstract and concrete,\nconsistently blurred in our work, is between a natural science with ideas that can be\ndisconfirmed, directly or indirectly, by experimental observation and the thinking of\nmathematics as an a priori field in the sense of Kant. The modern Platonic view\n157\nsuch as that held by Rene Thom is that once accepting a set of natural givens,\ncalled the axioms, the rest of the knowledge of this reality grows in the form of\ntheorems that relate to the axioms and each other through their logical consistency.\nKnowledge of reality is moved by the ever-forward mathematical refinement of a\npriori conditions to do away with the theorems’ exceptions, called counter examples.\nThe Hebraic Bible’s view of signifiers such as words and symbols is close to,\nbut not identical with, the Platonic view of mathematical formalism. According to the\nTorah, God made the word with words. God spoke and the world became real. The\nAramaic for “I create in speaking” is avara k’davara , or as the magician says, as he\nwaves his wand over an apparently empty black high hat, abracadabra. The\nHebrew word for word, davar, also signifies thing. This view contrasts with the\nmathematical formalists, among them Hilbert, who considered the signifiers of\nabstract mathematics simply symbols used in a game, the rules of which being\narbitrary, must include proofs of consistencies among them. Consistency from the\npoint of view of physics was addressed by Hertz, in Die Prinzipien der\nMechanik,(1894), where he expressed the formalist theoretical physicist’s work as\n“…within our own minds we create images or symbols of the external objects, and\nwe construct them in such a way that the logically necessary consequences of the\nimages are again the images of the physically necessary consequences of the\nobjects.”\nIn another set of related contrasts, the constructionist mathematician will\nargue that mathematical assertions are only true if they can be demonstrated, found\nor constructed. In contrast, the classical school of mathematics can develop the\ncase for the truth of mathematical statements if they are consistent with field’s\nnetwork of theorems and proofs, even if, up to the current time, no specific example\nof this truth can be demonstrated. The former can be thought of as a builder, the\nlatter as a discoverer. For example, suppose we try to make a proposition about\nperfect numbers where a perfect number is defined as being equal to half the sum\nof its divisors. Using the perfect number 6, we find that its non-identity divisors are\n1, 2, and 3 and half of their sum = 6. Our proposition: either there exists an odd\nperfect number, or else there exists no odd perfect number. An expression of this\n158\nforced decision between yes and no is called the excluded middle. The\nconstructionist mathematician, an orientation without the excluded middle, asserts\nthat “an odd perfect number exists” would only be meaningful if one could show that\nsuch a number had been found or constructed. The classical mathematician would\nfind the phrase “no odd perfect number exists” meaningful without a concrete\nexample, if the assumption of its existence would lead to a no (versus yes)\ncontradiction encountered in the proof-relevant network of established theorems\nand their relations. The symbolic operations of these formal schools of mathematics\nand their relationship to the objective and ideational realities of brain-mind-spiritual\nlife have been viewed by some as Western cultural products rather than\nexpressions of secular or spiritual Absolutes. Still others have argued that cultural\nrelativism is not relevant here because mathematicians worldwide constitute a\nmonoculture.\nWith respect to the real world existence of abstract mathematical structure,\nour Platonic bias must be obvious. The thrilling experience of a new reality I get to\nknow from finally understanding how a theorem works and the rush of peering into\nthe grandeur of the Grand Canyon feel like the same kind of full-of-wonder high to\nme. I blend them here without reservation. Perhaps this world of spiritual abstraction\nis closer to the orientation of the school of intuitionist mathematics. Its founder,\nL.E.J. Brouwer, required that every mathematical construction be so immediately\napparent to the human mind that no formal proof was necessary. This became my\nform of spiritual transcendence, which led naturally to a mathematical, mystical\nfaith.\nWe carry the explication of this kind of reality further. Reflections of the good\nand evil, right and left, moral directional biases and their relative weightings in born\nagain bifurcations to invariant circles called limit cycles, can be symbolically\nrepresented in what are called the complex eigenvalues of matrices describing the\nsystem’s set of orthogonal motions with changes in their control parameters. The\nbehavior of these complex eigenvalues underlies and characterizes the\nmathematical mechanism of the Hopf bifurcation.\n159\nThe subject of complex eigenvalues brings up in me the emotionally\ndisturbing subject of imaginary and complex numbers. I can still feel a little of my\nearlier anxiety. The episode started benignly enough. Our high school’s freshman\nalgebra class was studying how to solve quadratic equations, equations in which\nthe highest power of an expression was two. Told to work at the blackboard in front\nof the class, I was given the problem of finding the two values of x that were the\nroots of the equation, 5x 2 + 3x + 4 = 0. I had been taught to use the memorized\nquadratic formula,\n2\n− b±\nb −4ac\nx = , in which a = 5, b = 3 and c = 4. I always\n2a\ncalculated the square root part first and wound up with the expression,\n9 − 80 = −71.\nI can still feel the sinking feeling in my stomach as I looked at the\nresult. I anticipated the usual snide remarks and embarrassment as I contemplated\ndoing what I did not know how to do, take the square root of a negative number. Mr.\nKirby, the retired mechanical engineer who was my high school freshman algebra\nteacher tried to help, but I did not trust him. It seemed to me that he had already\nhumiliated me in front of the class, several times. He asked, “… what number when\nsquared, multiplied by itself, would equal –1.” He then asked it another way: solve\nthe following equation for x: x 2 +1 = 0. Seeing something I could do, I wrote the next\nline quickly x 2 = -1 and then, taking the square root of both sides, I wrote x = − 1 .\nHe then asked me what that meant. I answered by writing quickly, glibly and blindly\nthat that meant that − 1×\n− 1=−1. He asked me to explain what that meant by\ngiving him an example from the real world. Not yet knowing about imaginary and\ncomplex (combine real and imaginary numbers), I stood head down, ashamed and\nsilent, thinking that my smart friend Jerry Blau would get the answer immediately.\nMr. Kirby said he would go on with the class while I continued to stand in front of the\nblackboard and thought about it. He told me to interrupt him when I was ready to\nanswer. Some classmates were smirking, others giggled aloud. They had seen him\ndo this to me before.\nMr. Kirby, a short, muscular man, an ex-marine with a military haircut and a\nbrusque manner, lectured that mathematical competence and obedience to\nauthority and class discipline were all of a piece. I asked him about mathematical\n160\ncreativity and he said that this class was certainly not about that. I disliked and\nfeared him. He seemed to feel (and wrote a note to my parents to the effect) that,\nbeing “too arrogant” I needed to be “brought down a peg or two.” I had gotten the\nbest grades in the first two exams and was enjoying the role of after school tutor for\nsome of my friends. I suspect I was getting pretty egotistical. In class, I found myself\neagerly shouting out answers without holding up my hand, behavior that Mr. Kirby\nmet with his characteristic look of fatigued disgust. Twice I was thrown out of class\nfor my introjections. He then began to give me problems that I could not do, for\nwhich I was not prepared. This left me standing at the blackboard until the end of\nthe hour, after all the rest of the students had solved theirs and sat down. On\nparent’s night, Mr. Kirby told my father that I needed more “social and intellectual\ndiscipline.”\nInspired and personally directed hard work and socially defined correct\nbehavior were not synonymous to this arrogant 13 year old who had already\nbrought chagrin to his mother, the conservatory classical piano instructor, with his\nsatirical pianistic jazzy composition called “How High the Moonlight Sonata.” I was\nalso a secret reader of the book on the top back shelf in my father’s library by Jack\nHanley called “How to Make Mary; A Gentlemen’s Guide to Seduction.” In Mr.\nKirby’s class, inspired by the book, I sometimes reached behind me, through the\ncrack in my desk seat, to caress the inside part of the long smooth legs and\nsometimes moist panties of a well developed, tall and beautiful brunette girl behind\nme. I was never caught and she pretended that nothing was happening. In fact, she\nnever talked to me outside of class. I felt then, vaguely, and now, more specifically,\nthat a content enriched, instinctually titillated and excited unconscious could lead\nme to the solutions of intellectual challenges if it were both sufficiently indulged and\nuntrammeled, left alone in its work of being itself. Mr. Kirby did not see things that\nway.\nSince then, among my graduate and post-doctoral students in the\nneurosciences, I have learned that the Mr. Kirby’s of modern American educational\npractice have ruined generations of potential mathematicians and physical\nscientists. Worse, they have created generations of very bright math phobics who\n161\nrun to other graduate fields such as biology and medicine and come to resist the\npotentially humiliating incursions of new and potentially helpful abstract ideas and\noperations from mathematics and physics into their fields. They do not want their\npersecutory versions of Mr. Kirby to take up residence once again in their heads. I\ncan still feel his negative presence during long hours of struggle with the ego\ndeflating feelings of dumbness that an understanding of almost any new\nmathematical concept requires of me. Holding Mr. Kirby’s voice off as long as I can\nuntil, sometimes, the wonderful “aha!” experience arrives. I have tried to forgive him\nsince but forgetting him has not been possible.\nIt turns out that in the world of elementary, physically representative, real\nnumbers, the square root of a negative number has no meaning. Such a number\nhas understandably come to be called imaginary. Was this the answer Mr. Kirby\nwanted? There was some conflict among mathematicians in the 17 th\nand 18 th\nCentury about the arbitrary definition of −1\nas an imaginary number. It was\nsymbolized by a letter, i, that is −1 ≡ i . The existence of i extended the range of\nalgebraic definitions so that a solution of the quadratic formula as above could be\nfound for the square root of a negative number. A further expansion of this idea was\nto that of a complex number that can have both a real and an imaginary part. For\nexample, letting letters be generalized representations of numbers, a complex\nnumber might be written, a + bi, real number a + real number b times i, the letters\nsuch as a, b, c, d… symbolized real numbers. Consistent with membership in an\nalgebraic system, a + bi and c + di can be added and multiplied. This extension of\nthe real numbers into the imaginary realm permitted d’Alembert’s and Gauss’s\nproofs (and many, more complete ones since) of the powerful Fundamental\nTheorem of Algebra from which the faith derives about always being able to find at\nleast one solution to an algebraic equation. It was proven that any n th\nalgebraic equation (e.g.\nhas at least one real or complex root.\nx\nn\ndegree\nn 1\n+ x − + ... = 0 ) with real or complex coefficients always\nCloser to an image that helps make intuitive connections with human born\nagain bifurcations, limit cycles and directional splitting is the geometric interpretation\nof a complex number, let us now call it z. As above, algebraically, z is the sum of a\n162\nreal part a, plus b times the imaginary part, bi”; that is, z = a + bi. We can then set\nup a geometric space to represent z by imagining a two dimensional plane with the\nhorizontal real axis extending from left to right, the usual x axis, and the vertical\ndimension, called the imaginary axis, extending from bottom to top like the standard\ny axis. These two axes, going from negative values to positive ones, left to right and\nbottom to top, cross at the shared value of 0. Thus a and b can be visualized as the\nrectangular coordinates of a point in the plane and the point locates the complex\nnumber, z = a + bi. Since real parts and imaginary parts are like apples and pears\nand for addition, like must be added to like, if two complex numbers, a + bi and c +\ndi are equal, then a = c and b = d and their sum is written (a + c) + (b + d) i.\nNow that we’ve set up a point z on the plane, located with a complex number\nat z = a + bi, we can then draw an arrow, called a vector, from the intersection of the\nimaginary and real axis at 0 to this point z. Its length from 0 to z, 0z, we’ll call that\nlength ρ , is the size or amplitude-like modulus of the complex number, z = a +bi.\nThe angle this 0z vector makes with the real, 0a-axis, lets call this angle φ , is called\nthe argument of complex number z = a +bi. ρ is a length that can grow or shrink, φ\nis an angle that can rotate. We imagine vectorial movement like that of a variable\nlength hand of a clock. This geometric explication of complex numbers prepares us\nto visualize complex numbered eigenvalue solutions to matrices representing the\nrelevant equations that bifurcate to limit cycles and directional good and evil\nsplitting. ρ represents the dilatable clock’s radial amplitude of circular motion and\nφ , the angle of vectorial turning from the 0a-axis.\nThe complex conjugate of the complex number, a + bi is the complex number\na – bi in which the sign of the imaginary part is reversed. Geometrically, this means\nthat a pair of complex conjugate numbers with the ρ ’s of both having below zero\nvalues relative to the 0a-axis, that is negative real parts, could be imagined as the\npoints indicated by two same sized, mirror image, clock hands pointing at 8:00 and\n10:00 o’clock. Note that the φ , the angle of vectorial deviation of the arrow pair from\nthe 0a-axis, turn in opposite directions in these mirror image moving clock hand\nvectors. Without going deeper into the representation of the actions of the system in\n163\nquestion (its differential equation) in the form of what is called its Jacobian matrix of\npartial derivatives (a matrix representation of the differential equation indicating\northogonal directional velocities of change of locations of the components of the\nmotion with respect to changing values of the control parameter), we know that\nwhen the ρ of the matrix’s set of two complex conjugate eigenvalues is less than\nzero, ρ < 0, the orbit representing the system, spirals into a stable fixed point. This\nis analogous to going to the bottom of the parabolic attractor basin as described\nabove. Values of the invisible eigenvalues and their changes constitute the abstract\nmathematical mechanisms underlying the observable dynamics of the system\nobservable physically.\nThe mathematical mechanism underlying the Hopf bifurcation of fixed points\ninto limit cycles (associated with bi-directional splitting that accompanies the\namphetamine transformation into limit cycle stereotypy of rigid ideas and equally\nlikely mirror image motions in the directions of good versus evil) is the crossing of\nthe systems real valued parts, ρ ’s, of its complex conjugate eigenvalues into\npositive territory, ρ > 0. The mirror image of clock arrows is transformed from 8:00\nand 10:00 o’clock to the clock locations of 4:00 and 2:00. At a Hopf bifurcation, a\npair of complex conjugate eigenvalues crosses the imaginary (vertical) axis such\nthat is real parts have positive value. In the orbit representing the motions of the\nsystem itself, the fixed point disappears to be replaced by the action spiraling out to\nan invariant circle. This is analogous to our manifold image of the disappearance of\nthe central attractive point and the sudden appearance of a small hill at the bottom\nof a parabolic basic of attraction.. The new attractor is an invariant circular path\naround the hill, with the spiraling out to the invariant circle being a two dimensional\npicture of the disappearance of the bowl-bottom and appearance of a missing point,\nhill top fixed point and a spiral flow to the path circling the hill. Underlying the\ntransition from a fixed point to a limit cycling, invariant circle, are a pair of mirror\nimage complex conjugate eigenvalues that turn in mirror image, we could say, good\nversus evil, opposite directions. The Hopf bifurcating system inevitably has both.\nThe implications of this very abstract metaphor for the emergent limit cyclesplitting\nstyle of spiritual transformation can be made deeper by considering the\n164\ncommon practice of Rumi’s Mevlevi (and other) orders of Islamic Dervishes that\nfacilitate the onset and maintenance of their ecstatic states by an improvisational\ndance which goes from rocking to irregular whirling. The Dervish teaching tales\nplace a symbolic emphasis on the power of the rotating wheel, the circling of the\nheavenly bodies, the mill wheel and the millstone. As Rumi said, “The mountain of\nthe sun I’ll fashion to a mill. And as my waters run, I’ll turn thee at my will.” Note that\ntheir work toward spiritual transformation results in neither the emergence of the\ninvoluntary and rigid limit cycles of invariant circles or the associated divisive\ninternal eigensplitting of good self from evil other. The Sufi compass points to an\nintegrated field of divine consciousness, which contains the appearance of the\nworld’s multiplicity. In this profound unity, all humankind is perceived as one family.\nThe singular direction of all prayer, Salat, five times a day, at dawn, high noon,\nafternoon, sunset and an hour after sunset, turns the entire world into a unified\ndirectional field of prayer. At its center, the Islamic pilgrims wander round and round\nthe black cube of the ancient shrine of Kaaba,\nThis leaves one with the speculation that we started with: that the simple,\nauthoritarian rules of the amphetamine, roll-up and splitting religions may be\nintrinsically more vulnerable to unpredictable breakouts into morally inconsistent\nactions and that the righteously rigid limit cyclists are invariantly split into\nambivalence. In contrast, the more free form, chaotic turns of the entheogenic\ndervish define us all as belonging to one unified ecstatic field.\nFurther Readings for Amphetamine Roll-Up And Splitting\nPsychology and Religion.

Attending synagogue or church without the promise of a\nmystical high seemed like a superstitious rabbit foot rubbing for personal health and\nsafety and a sharing of propitious contacts for social and economic advantage. Why\nelse?\nI have had the good feel of what Jews call Tzedakah, the sharing of supplies\nby the haves for the betterment of the have nots. I have known the quiet calm of\nhuman right action as in the Unitarian Universalist’s serving the needy, open and\nflexible, intimate mindfulness of others and their needs. Considering E.O. Wilson’s\nbrand of brain herd biology of altruism gives me a warm feeling about the potentially\nintrinsic goodness of man. But compared with the Jamesian brands of ecstatic\ntranscendence, minds blown in Sufi twirling, Orthodox Jewish chanting, rocking and\ndancing, hands-in-the-air praying and hands-on-the-head healings of Wednesday\nnight Pentecostal services, the soberly serious social engagement and\n168\nresponsibility sermons of Reformed Judaism and the Unitarians as well as the 19 th\nCentury hymns and high I.Q. apologetics of some Presbyterian and Methodist\nclergy, are like near beer. Formally equivalent but without the rush and the delicious\nrisk and promise of life long addiction.\nNational opinion polls have found my preference for churchly fireworks in\nreligious experience quite common. My Charismatic Christian sons are among the\nmany with a preference for and loving labeling of these kinds of houses of worship\nas rock and roll churches. In a recent survey of Americans, 46% of respondents\nclaim to be twice born, Evangelical Christians. Perhaps unfortunate with respect to\ntheir children’s academic and professional ambitions, 48% do not accept a\nDarwinian view of biology. Fifty million American readers are now buying books with\nplots taken from the Babylonian prophecies and anticipate the Rapture of Return\nwith weekly, joyful, mini-rehearsals. They include praying in tongues as the Spirit\nmoves them like Peter, John, James and the rest of the one hundred and twenty in\nthe upper room on the day of Pentecost.\nThose of us with two or more available cable religious networks can, on any\ngiven Sunday morning, choose a smiling, kind, Proverbs quoting, rational\nPresbyterian liturgical stylist. In his seventies, standing tall with a full head of white\nhair and in a quietly resonant voice, he delivers a sermon about seven ways to\navoid growing old. His list includes learning new things and continuing to work. His\nspiritual proposal was about personal faith, always leaning on the Lord. On another\nnetwork, the three hundred pound, restlessly pacing preacher of the Cornerstone\nAssembly of God Church of San Antonio, Texas, stood in front of large maps of Iraq\nand the Middle East. He preached from Ezekiel about the refleshing of dry bones\nand a return of all Jews to Israel. He said that contributions to his church over the\npast year helped finance the return of 4000 Russian Jews to Israel. He reiterated\nthe promise that, when the return was completed, there would be a massive Islamic\nattack on Jerusalem and “we will all rise up to Heaven” in an ecstatic\ndisappearance. Jews, as long as they accepted Jesus as their Savior, were\nwelcomed along on the ride. More then two thousand parishioners erupted into loud\napplause along with shouts of “praise Jesus.”\n169\nAn inkling of something entirely different, neither human psychology nor\nfrenzy, was an unanticipated benefit of being at England’s Warwick University in\nsabbatical residence in Math House #2. This large, round, many windows and black\nboards, study with a small upstairs bedroom was one of the apartments for visiting\nprofessors behind the Warwick Mathematics Institute in the English Midlands. I\nattended a variety of churches and synagogues on the weekends. The perspective\nthat emerged for me at Warwick was that rabbinic Haggadah, inferences to be\ndrawn from imaginatively spawned narrative, isn’t the same thing as Halakhah, the\nlaw dictated by Jewish legal tradition; that geometric insight and other intuitions\naren’t the same as mathematical proofs; that the mystical visions of the English\nromantic poet and illustrator, William Blake, were not necessarily consistent with the\nscientific observations and logical arguments of the contemporary Scottish\nphilosopher, David Hume. Paul Tillich wrote that the wisdom attendant to primary\nspiritual experience that was without the unconditional character of sensible moral\nobligation was not to be trusted without critical analyses. I learned that among High\nEpiscopal and Reformed Jewish English academics, God is not a hallucinogen, but\nmore like a spiritually based, social contract.\nIn his 1929 essay, Mysticism and Logic, Bertrand Russell noted mysticism’s\npreference for: (a) Insight over discursive analytic knowledge; (b) Belief in the unity\nof all things over oppositions or divisions in representational thought; (c) The denial\nof the reality of time, even in the divisions of past, present and future; (d) Belief that\nevil is unreal, manufactured by the innate divisiveness in some analytic intellects. In\nmodern brain hemispheric and other neuropsychological philosophies, these\ncountervailing descriptions of external observables can grow naturally out of the\nbrain’s abilities to maintain logically incompatible perspectives simultaneously.\nRight-brain aesthetic holism in contrast with left-brain categorical analytics recalls a\npopular example. Would one chose Blake or Hume to better explain how the time\ndimensions of memory disappear with the scent of a past lover or the hearing of his\nfavorite music for lovemaking.\nIn the inevitable mix of primitive instinct with high purpose, the visiting\nprofessors’ Math House #2 had an aura of infamy. It was the one in which, by the\n170\naccidental intrusion of a campus security officer, the brilliantly eccentric Northern\nCalifornia mathematician, Ralph Abraham, was famously arrested for pot smoking.\nThe campus officer told me that, late one night, thinking he had smelled fire, he\nused his master key to make an unwelcome entrance. The incident became part of\nthe record in House of Commons hearings about the intellectual and moral decay of\nEnglish Universities. Apparently, even among English intellectuals, there were trivial\nand politicized definitions of virtue.\nChristopher Zeeman, the head of the Mathematics Institute was a worldclass\ntopologist who, among other things, demonstrated biological and socialpsychological\napplications of Rene Thom’s Catastrophe Theory. I was invited as a\nbrain person and amateur mathematician, to see what might result from mixing me\nwith members of his fine mathematics faculty. In addition to learning some\nbifurcation and lots of ergodic (statistical) theory, my chats with Christian and\nJewish mathematicians on Saturday and Sunday morning visits to the synagogues\nand chapels of Oxford and Cambridge introduced me to an English intellectual’s\nreligious tradition. The spirit of C.S. Lewis was still very much alive. Surprising,\nhowever, was that more than a few of these scholars had the elements of Christian\nfaith in full menu: virgin birth, incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, original sin and\nthe promise of salvation. I was disabused of my belief that these elements of\nChristian belief were incompatible with high mental capacity and intellectual\nsophistication.\nYet, the spiritual climate of these English intellectual Christians were different\nfrom today’s post, post Vietnam return of the religious themes of the turn of the\nTwentieth Century, big tent revivalism and Billy Sunday’s brand of Christian patriotic\nAmerica. Today’s religious patriotism infuses George W. Bush’s Republican base,\nNational Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice’s after dinner hymns and Attorney\nGeneral John Ashcroft’s early morning bible study groups for his Assistant Attorney\nGenerals. Even the most religious of my English math buddies are without what\nseems like adventitious baggage of today’s faith based Republicans: the belief in\nthe immorality and godlessness of teaching evolution in schools, what has been\ncalled the massacre of the innocents in stem cell research and abortion clinics, the\n171\nright to bear machine guns and the intrinsically venal sinfulness of a man’s\ncommitment in love of another man. Was the clustering of these apparently diverse\nconcerns the accidental result of a sociopolitical-religious short circuit, a classresentment-driven\nspiritual split in geographic, socioeconomic and educational\nclass? Tim LeHay is selling millions of books, whole tables full at Wal-Mart’s, which\ncome packaged with these assumptions.\nSurely higher-level theists would make today’s evil more subtle, abstract and\npervasive, perhaps involving inner life themes of envy, vengeance and aggression;\ngoodness implicating empathically made moral choices involving interpersonal\nkindness and evidence of caring about the well being of others. My contact with\nsome English academicians taught me that even the mathematics of hard science\ncan be viewed as a gift of grace and belief in the possibility of a continually\nemerging, Christ-centered, evolutionary process. Protestant philosopher\nmathematician Alfred North Whitehead in his 1926 Religion in the Making, Catholic\nanthropologist priest, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin in his The Phenomenon of Man\nand the more modern process theologists of New York’s Union Theological\nSeminary do not exclude Christ’s involvement in evolving science and other new\nknowledge. They see Him participating in a spiritual evolutionary progress which\ndoes not gather the barnacles of irrational ideas about the murder of less than\nhundred-cell blastula or the psychoneurohormonally determined sexual partner\npreference. They know about the ever-changing cultural and political appearances\nof faux and real evil. Nonetheless, what I learned from my Christian and Jewish\nfriends at the mathematics institute was that, though the definitions of evil may\nchange, evil as a construct and spiritual mechanism is an apparently essential\ncomponent of the Christian experience. On Rosh Hashanah, even the reformed\nJews commit themselves to Teshuvah, making up for past evil deeds. The good\nversus evil dichotomous view of man’s existence is true in the lives of Assembly of\nGod Fundamentalists of Georgia as well as the sophisticated Readers, Professors\nand Dons of the high Episcopal churches and university chapels of Oxford and\nCambridge.\n172\nFinding high-level mathematical thinkers at home in metaphysical surrounds\nand metaphysicians diligently practicing mathematics are certainly not new. Some\ninstructive examples include, famously, the Pythagoreans, the 15 th Century Catholic\nCardinal Nicholas Von Cusa, who used geometric symbols to record his spiritual\nphilosophy, and the Talmudic-Cartesian style of argumentation of Nicholas de\nSpinoza. This approach to an examination of metaphysical systems, sometimes\ncalled mathematicism, exploits the machinery of the mathematical mind to evaluate\nthe consistency and completeness of thoughts, to create representative axiomatic\nstructures and to operate within them using syntactic calculus. The practice of the\nrational dialectic of mathematicism, working for moral purity of heart, develops a\nbrain-somatic discipline much like the exercises of Yoga.\nThis approach flies in the face of the major premise of these essays, my\nbelief in the necessity of what William James and others have called the primary\nreligious experience in order to know God. Recall that my father’s favorite Jewish\nmystic, Abraham Abulafia, said this experience gives birth to an activated mind that\ncan then immediately and completely inform the Spirit. Among the religious English\nmathematicians, I learned that it doesn’t have to happen this way. One can\napparently think oneself to It. A well known example of a modern theistic Oxford\ntype, the Magdalene College English tutor and Don, C.S. Lewis, in his introduction\nto St. Athanasius’s The Incarnation of the Word of God, wrote, “…I believe that\nmany who find that nothing happens when they sit down or kneel down with a book\nof devotion, might find that their heart would sing unbidden while they are working\ntheir way through a tough bit of theology with a pipe in their teeth and a pencil in\ntheir hand…” In contrast, without my personal experiences with joyful\ntranscendence, the direct feeling of His presence, I would not have known about the\ngoals of his more analytic efforts. It was a struggle for me to use a rational mind to\nshare the meanings of the poetic ruminations in his BBC lectures, Mere Christianity.\nThis Reader from Oxford with two firsts in Latin and Greek followed by another first\nin English Literature, described the world as “…enemy occupied territory…” the\nomnipresence of the Good Power turned Dark Power of the Prince of Darkness and\nthe Christian as “…a man who is enabled to repent and pick himself up…”\n173\nFor C.S. Lewis, religious faith came from intellectual hard work. He was put\noff by spirituality that arrived by thoughtless fiat. He rejected the idea of living in\nsimple and loving direct conversation with the God within, as described by Brother\nLawrence. Lawrence was described as the simple “great awkward fellow who broke\neverything.” Lewis had little faith in what he perceived as the mindless spiritual\nmethodology of this selfless, silent, hard working Parisian monastery cook for a\nhundred fellow monks who was also their dedicated smelly sandal repairer. Perhaps\nreflecting his place in the British intellectual class system, Lewis wrote that\nLawrence’s conversations and letters in the brief pamphlet, Practice of the\nPresence of God, “…full of truth… but unctuous and repulsive.” At the same time,\nLewis spoke of his own experiential evidence for God in Surprised by Joy in which\nhe admits, “I am an empirical theist. I have arrived at God by induction.” It is likely\nthat Brother Lawrence did not know and did not need to know the difference\nbetween an inductive and deductive argument.\nFor most of my years, I have been a subject of Jamesian transcendent\nexperience, LSD expansive visions, Sufi moving meditation, long distance running,\nBlack Baptist shouting, Tantric orgasmic withholding, Yiddish Labovicher dancing,\nCharismatic Christian Church rock and rolling, Hindi meditative rising Kundalini,\nalmost any ecstatic crisis inducing, God type. Recall that I am from a generation\nthat a Donovan song inspired to smoke bananas. I did not personally access\nBrother Lawrence’s calm, work-a-day, devotional, quietly persistent, perspective\nyielding, inner conversations with God until my sixth decade. The opportunity came\nfrom my growingly severe, unfixably chronic, pain. The counter-intuitive insight and\nhelpful identification was gained from reading about Joseph de Beaufort’s\nconversations with Brother Lawrence. Beaufort said Lawrence was born with the\nname Nicholas Herman in 1611 and renamed Lawrence in honor of his parish\npriest. As young soldier in the Thirty Years War of the 17 th Century, he was severely\ninjured. He was left with both sciatic nerves trapped between bone spurs and tissue\nscarring from his early twenties. These injuries, involving the two biggest painconducting\nnerves in the body, left him crippled in gait and in chronically severe\nlower back and leg pain from which he would never be free. It was after this time\n174\nand a few years of looking for God in what he called “wondering in the wilderness”\nthat he began his 40 years of monastery service as cook and sandal maker. He was\ndescribed as amazingly selfless and a “…gentle man of joyful spirit…” who\n“…continually walked with God…not from the head but from the heart…” Doing long\nhours of selfless work with such painful disabilities, how was it that he maintained\nhis joyful, loving and calm contact with God and his fellow man? How did he do it? I\nfound that, as with all miracles of God contact for me, it happened by itself.\nI suffered my first testicular cancer in my thirties. I felt the little hard rock by\naccident while scratching. It was on the left side. Surgical removal was followed by\na five-hour radical abdominal lymph node dissection that left me with incidental\nabdominal sympathetic nerve damage, urinary hesitancy and ejaculating backwards\ninto my bladder. The tissue diagnosis was of embryonic cell carcinoma with\nchorionic elements. The U.S. Armed Service Pathology Department’s statistical\nbook gave me 5% chance of living beyond two years. My second testicular cancer\noccurred in my fifties and on the right, two little joined lumps found by my wife. It\nwas a seminoma with cure rate of 85% but requiring four weeks of almost daily x-\nray treatment. The combination of radiation induced blood vessel scarring (they had\nto blast widely since my earlier lymph node dissection confused the usual\nradiological anatomy), a pre-existing laterally curved spinal column and the arthritic\nchanges resulting from fifteen years of running over 10 miles per day with this kind\nof back led eventually to the degeneration and collapse of several of the bodies of\nmy vertebrate pinching several leg nerves between bone spurs and radiationinduced\nscarring. I have been in increasingly severe back and leg pain for fifteen\nyears.\nIt was in this way that I fell heir to both Brother Lawrence pain syndrome and\nwhat I now think was his strong inclination to live in the Spirit, as far as possible\noutside the concerns with his own mental and physical body. In my experience, this\nled naturally to a decreased in my life long narcissistic preoccupations, diminished\nmy ego-driven achievement desperation, setting up a more comfortable inner\nseating for conversations about and with God. The choice was between fully\nembracing a God-oriented place for most of my daily existence or the chronic use of\n175\nenough narcotics to eliminate complexity of thought, real interpersonal feelings and\nhope for meaningfully creative work. The remarkable thing to me was that people\nbegan to talk about my “improved disposition,” an increase in out-of-mypsychiatrist’s\noffice personal empathy and kindness as well as a significant\ndecrement in my overweening, ego-stoking ambitious and competitive urges. Any\nreturn to the earth body of tense readiness to competitively succeed, protect with\nego defensive anger, fantasies of assertive sexuality, stand tall grandiose notions of\nintellectual superiority, even getting up for scientific combat, was accompanied by\nthe return to this world of pain. Only lovingly detached, unpretentious, other\ndirected, quietly calm inner dialogue with Him was a place that I could live. This was\nan inner land of still another kind of God than I had previously known. I could even\nread and struggle with theological ideas thoughtfully, without referencing personal\nmystical, psychopharmacological, Holy Ghost-mimetic, experiences. I could enjoy\nthe rational, social responsibility valuing, spiritual peace of a white Protestant\nSunday morning service. I could attend Reformed Jewish Friday night services\nabout man’s responsibility to man without restless boredom. No longer seeking the\nfeeling of God’s thrill, I could think about it, even without being in the state of my\nfather’s and Abulafia’s activated mind.\nIf I had been benefited with a classical language education beyond the high\nschool and early college Latin of Julius Caeser and Cicero or matriculated in an\nacademic theological seminary, I would have already studied, maybe even worn\nout, the deeper aspects of what seemed like a paradox of the consonance of faith\nand reason. I would have been familiar with the rhetorical argumentation in the\npatristic Latin commentary on sacred texts by Tertullian and other Fathers of the\nearly Christian Church, the Talmudic discussions (the Mishna in Hebrew and\nGemora in Aramaic) of the oral Torah by the Rabbinate, the Muslim explication of\nKoranic Islam in the oral tradition of the Hadith. Robert Wilken in his recent The\nSpirit of Early Christian Thought was in no doubt about the harmonic relationship\nbetween rationality and faith: “…by putting itself in the service of truth, faith enables\nreason to exercise its power in realms to which it would otherwise have no\n176\naccess…” It is perhaps strange to come to this common knowledge so late, but I\ncame to my life with my forbearers and father’s magical, mystical biases.\nMy father had parodied what he thought was the “wasteful time” spent in\nrational, Talmudic discussion. He said that is what Jewish men spent their time\ndoing to avoid physical work while sitting near the city gates. It was the women who\nraised the crops and cared for the cattle and children. He had a favorite conundrum\nsatirizing the village gate discussions. Jewish males, after the age of thirteen,\naccompany their morning prayer of commitment to loving and serving God with the\nritual of wrapping scripture embedded animal skin, tefillin, and winding them seven\ntimes around the left arm, near the heart, and around the head, symbolizing the\nmind. This contextualizes how my father made fun of a typical topic of these all\nmale Talmudic seminars: “If one had seven arms, would one wrap the tefillin once\naround each appendage or seven times about one of them. If the latter is the case,\nhow would one chose which one.” In fact, there remains an on-going debate about\nthe order with which the embedded four passages from Exodus and Deuteronomy\nshould be arranged and inserted in the tefillin such that some compromising\northodox Jews wear two types of tefillin, each representing one of the theoretically\njustified orderings. I know now that there is an implicitly positive confirmation of a\njointly held faith and feeling of ethnic belonging achieved by such apparently\nabstract discourse and argumentation.\nIn truth, I had not come to Warwick to explore the relationships between faith\nand rationality using the cognitive style of mathematicism, but rather to be saved by\nthe mathematical miracles of the Brain God. Not unrelated to what C.S. Lewis saw\nas a prominent characteristic of spiritual experience, “wonder,” and what Philip\nDavis and Reuben Hersh in their 1981 book, The Mathematical Experience, spoke\nof as “beauty” and “surprise.” I know about the attack of excitement that comes with\nthe sudden emergence of counterintuitive conceptual connections while exploring\nnew mathematical ideas. In energetic high, I start skip reading, underlining the book\nfrantically, jotting commentary on the margins, copying the relevant equations into\nmy notebook. Was this the same break through to a glimmering of grace, everything\nbeautifully in order and precious, that I experienced on LSD while sitting for hours\n177\ninside Paris’s towering, echoing, Notre Dame Cathedral, hearing Latin chants in the\ndank sweet smell of old church and chained, swinging canisters of smoking incense\nas the pipe organ roared? Those realities that George Berkeley, the 1721 author of\nTreatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge, the theist whose name\nwas given to a mostly agnostic Northern California city, saw as grounded in the\nspirituality of God’s infinite mind and broadcast as universal ideas through our\nderivative, finite minds. Rational religion and mystical religion joined in faith by the\npresence of implicit and universal mathematical structure\nI spent about two years at a mathematics institute in France, Institute des\nHautes Etudes, IHES, sitting at the guru feet of the mathematical great and\nmetaphysician, Rene Thom. His mathematical pallet was breathtakingly broad, a\ntaste of what in past centuries was called natural philosophy and what seemed to\nme to be about the unapologetic geometrization of the Intuitive God of the Mind.\nNatalie Angiers, erstwhile mathematician, now reporter and atheistic hard ass,\nwriting in the New York Times, called Thom’s ideas the talk of “…an Emperor\nwithout clothes…” The Kantian theme of the personal a priori status of an intuitive\ngeometry, an already in us representation of all that’s out there, was implicit in his\nCatastrophe Theory research program and was published first in his classical\nStructural Stability of Morphogenesis (1977) and made more overt in his later\n(1990) Semiophysics.\nTo get a feeling for the rational-logical versus mystical-intuitive spiritual issue\nin a mathematical context, consider the following: most of us remember the struggle\nto unify the strange and difficult cognitive duality of the high school geometry\nexperience. On one hand, shapes and their relations and rearrangements could be\nintuitively grasped, even manipulated; on the other hand, we were taught that these\nmental images and the results of their intuitive transformations were not to be\ntrusted.\nIn mathematics, as in my belief in the fireworks of primary religious\nexperience, seeing is not necessarily believing. In my high school geometry class,\nwhat was to be believed was what followed from the proper practice of the tightly\norganized, Euclidean system of axioms, postulates and the derivative logical\n178\noperations resulting in the surety of proofs. The unresolved tension about what I\nbelieved from intuitive experience and what I was allowed to believe from the logic\nof theorem and proof, perhaps not unlike my belief in the transcendent experience\nover logical theological argument as Reality, continued throughout my life. For\nexample, many decades later at IHES, I saw the world class dynamical systems\ntheorist and differential geometer-topologist, Dennis Sullivan, use a projector to\ndisplay a computer-generated, intricate and beautiful, mathematical object, the well\nknown, computer screen saver, Mandelbrot set. It represents the control parameter\nplane of the well studied complex analytic map, z → z 2 + c. Sullivan, pointing to a\nsmall, discrete complicated little part of it that looked like a little version of the whole\nof it, from a distance looking like a point, said, “An important Ph.D. dissertation is\nwaiting to be done on the question: is this (pointing to the little object) really there?”\nIn the audience of about a hundred professional mathematicians and one amateur, I\nwas the only one that laughed.\nHistorians of mathematics point to the successful generalization of Euclidian\ngeometry via its abstract axioms, postulates and logical operations to a new, not\nnaturally intuitable, almost nonvisualizable, non-Euclidean geometry (with the new\ngeometric axiom, parallel lines do meet at infinity), as evidence against the Kantian\nidea of the intuitively accessible, a priori status of geometry. This served as an\nexample of where mathematics naturally resides, and argues in favor of the thought\ncontrol imposed by the modern set theoretic and logical rituals of mathematical\ntheorem and proof. Thom, in a hereditary-evolutionary biological argument\ndeveloped in Semiophysics, said “Objections raised to the Kantian apriority of\nEuclidean geometry after the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries, and the\ntheories of twentieth century physics (restricted and general relativity, quantum\nmechanics) appear to me to be irrelevant…they deal with …the infinitely small and\ninfinitely large…which lies outside the usual cognitive activity of ancient man.”\nIn my discussions with him, Thom found equivalence relations between\nmental and real world objects and their behaviors. He described what he called an\nabstract physicalist truth that describes a psychic universe, which, in turn, simulates\noutside things and processes. Much like the transcendent experiential God I have\n179\nexperienced, seek and think I know about, Thom was not after the logical proofs of\ngeometry but rather viewed mathematical theorem and proof work as activity\nderived from intuitive experience with geometric relations as the thought forms that\nrepresented real Reality. Though a Field’s Medal winner in mathematics (recall that\nit is the Nobel Prize in mathematics awarded every four years at the International\nCongress of Mathematics) and for his life time, one of the most brilliant and fecund\nmathematicians in the world, so many mathematicians admit that they got the seeds\nof their life work from his throw away remarks, Thom, with a little smile and his eyes\ntwinkling, admitted to me with apparent pleasure that “I have never proven any\ntheorem in my life.” All his discoveries came from insightful moments of grace and\nthe courage to pursue them. Riding back from Paris late one night on a train that\ndidn’t stop at IHES’s town of Bures sur Y’vette, I watched him use the red\nemergency phone to call the train’s engineer to stop the train suddenly for our exit. I\nloved him, in part, because he had the courage to believe in and act on my kind of\nintuitively realizable, experiential God.\nIn keeping with his characteristic style of generalizing mathematical systems\nbeyond their carefully defined specifics, Thom defined the concept of singularity\nvery broadly, speaking of them as distinctive and noteworthy things, points where\nthe usual or expected properties, laws and definitions fail, where smooth and\ncontinuous processes become discontinuous. For Thom, these were the settings for\nthe unexpected and miraculous. He believed that his work and that of many others,\nnow and in the future, would indicate that the set of miraculous singularities were\nfinite, systematic, universal and describable. Most importantly for our purposes,\nThom believed them to be archetypal. It was through the structure of archetypal\nsingularities that he regarded inside and outside realities as mutually reflective.\nI was blessed by hours of discussion with him during his car travels to\nlecture around France. Thom often asked me to accompany him as he drove from\nIHES to various branches of the University of Paris. He used these times to\nexercise my geometrically flavored, mathematical intuitions. He used words to\ncreate visualizable structures without the diagrammatic aid of a blackboard. He\nused mental topological structures created by the properties of imagined motions,\n180\nflows, which led to examples of some of his universal singularities that he claimed\ncould be found in all real physical, biological and psychological systems. For some\nexamples: One of his archetypal singularities was a boundary at x = 0 such that the\nflow couldn’t spread from where it was in x ≥ 0 into x< 0 and was therefore like the\nborder, the membrane, between the inside and outside of a cell as well as the\nhoped for sociopolitical functions of the Great Wall of China and the Maginot Line. If\nwe were to blow up the boundary line from two to three dimensions, R\n2 →R 3 , the\nstraight boundary line becomes a cylinder for directionally organizing and\nconnecting flows as in blood vessels, oil pipes, cables and wires. Since production\nand delivery need not occur at similar rates, temporary storage is required and may\ntake the form of a spherical blow-up in the vertical segment of R 3 leading to an open\nbottle which may serve as a dead end storage branch of a network of connected\ncylinders. In the conceptual reductionism of Semiophysics, Thom said, “…life is\nessentially a question of embankment, canalization and the struggle to stem\ndispersion.” These structures of mind and world are built and maintained.\nCoagulation of blood is an example of a canalized fluid repairing gaps like a\ntubeless tire. Thom considered apparent the problem of making something from\nnothing, birth, that of finding the hidden sources: the bubbling spring emerges from\nan unseen, underground network of canalized fluid flow converging on the apparent\nsource, birth being the invisible becoming visible. In contrast, a canalized flow\nemptying into lake can represent disappearance as a flow.\nMathematicians from all over the world attended Thom’s 65 th birthday\ncelebration at IHES. His Field’s Medal winning work on the topology of differentiable\n(smooth) manifolds, cobordism and related ideas, was mentioned frequently, and\ngreat homage paid to him with respect to these areas of his work. However, in two\ndays of lectures of personal and professional tribute by the world’s great\nmathematicians, his work relevant to Catastrophe Theory and Semiophysics was\nnot mentioned, even once. The form taken by mathematicians’ most severe\njudgments is silence. As the New York Times’ Natalie Angier’s comments indicated,\nthis is not the time for the intuitive conduct of applied mathematics.\n181\nIt was upon Thom’s recommendation, that I spent the year in the\nMathematics Institute in Warwick, England. Using the Math House #2 s home base,\nI made many trips to Oxford University and a few to Cambridge. It was in these\nplaces that I learned first hand that belief in the Resurrection was not simply a\nmatter of socioeconomic class. I tried to schedule my trips to Oxford or Cambridge\nto coincide with the weekend so I could hear the remarkably literate sermons at the\nUniversities college chapels. In these places, for hundreds of years, just because\none was a top-notch practitioner of mathematics or linguistics did not mean that the\nDon did not have within him the full panoply of beliefs attendant to the Christian\nGod.\nMaybe this easy combination of logic and Spirit derives from the character of\nEnglish mathematics. There are graduates with professorially enfranchising Masters\nof Art Degrees in Mathematics from Cambridge University where the subject is\nconsidered by many to be part of the culture of the humanities, closely akin to\nphilosophy and linguistics.. In the universities of United States, for example the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, an academic degree of Ph.D. in\nmathematics is seen by most faculty as an indication of the intellectual equipment\nrequired for a life of scientific work in which disconfirmable experiments are the\nultimate criteria for knowledge. The field of pure mathematics (not ostensibly\nrelevant to the real world outside the mind) has itself evolved in this direction.\nRecently, a physical scientist, a theoretical physicist, Edward Witten, was given the\nmathematician’s ultimate award, the Field’s Medal. In American universities in\ngeneral, very few mathematics departments are in schools of the humanities. Most\nare in the schools of science. This variation in bureaucratic, metaphysical, sorting\nreflects our continuing struggle with the true nature of reality and the role of\nmathematics in its knowing. The now emergent field of computer science removes\nmathematics even further from intuition and Spirit. Difficult problems such as proofs\nof theorems can be systematically examined for all possibilities quickly by trying\nthem out in what is now known as a computational proof. On the other hand,\npointing at this computation’s graphics, the theorem and proof, real mathematicians\ncan ask, is this really there?\n182\nMentioned briefly above was one of humankind’s beacons, Pythagoras, the\nintellectual and spiritual progenitor of Plato. He taught the disciples of the\nPythagorean Brotherhood in Crotona, Italy, that reality at its deepest level was\nmathematical thought. Studies there included philosophy, geometry, music and\nastronomy, all at the service of achieving closer union with the Divine. Pythagoras\nand his school, only his student’s writings remain, was said to be working at unifying\nelements of the ancient tribal mystery cults with the observables of worldly events\nthrough meditative, mathematical, philosophical mysticism. Knowledge was gained\nthrough spiritual intuition made harmonious with formal systems of thought. As Plato\nlater said and as quoted by Thomas Heath in his 1921 History of Greek\nMathematics, about the study of the motion of stars, “…leave the heavens alone…”\nbecause what one sees is only an approximation of the real and more perfect\nmathematical structures involving points, lines and circles. To which Newton added\nan elongated circle, the ellipse, and Nineteenth and Twentieth Century\nmathematicians and physicists, the geometries of positively and negatively curved\nspace.\nIt is perhaps not an accident that debates about evidence for the existence\nand location of God and where the ideas and structures of mathematics live and\nbreath generally involves a stand off between those that believe that both are out\nthere and can be seen, like thoughtful, humanistic actions and caring service for\nneedful others, versus those that feel the phenomenology of both are projections of\nthe psychobiologically intuitive Brain God and can be felt like an ecstatic rush of\ninsightful illumination.\nFurther Reading for Faith And Rationality\nIntroduction of Comparative Mysticism.

Selz\nBiological Scientists Can Understand and Use Ideas and Methods of\nNonlinear Science\nA yield of advances in computer hardware and software is that even quite\ndifficult applied nonlinear mathematics can become accessible to experimentally\noriented biological scientists. Before this time, the development and analysis of a\nparticular set of nonlinear differential equations, describing the actions of a\nneurobiological system in motion, involved decades of specialty training, rare insight\nand many hours of highly skilled, trial and error computations by hand. Since the\nidiosyncrasies of each nonlinear system were considered unique, the results of their\nanalyses were thought to concern only the particular nonlinear system being\nstudied. Often a shift in hypothetical mechanism meant starting the long and painful\nprocess all over again. In addition, these findings were usually communicated only\nto a small and arcane mathematical community in the form of dense theorems and\ndifficult to follow proofs, insurmountable language barriers to biological researchers\nwishing to use them to better describe and understand their experimental\nobservations.\nFor today’s neuroscientist with a desktop computer, an inclination to program\nand access to computer algebra and numerical software such as Maple,\nMathematica or MatLab, operational definitions and computational empiricism can\nreplace the theorem and proof continuity required to do old style applied\nmathematics. For those of us without sufficient facility in algebraic manipulation to\neasily follow the arguments of professional mathematicians, a computer algebra\nprogram such as Maple serves as a delightfully accessible consultant with which to\n“check out what the guy is saying\". Those motivated enough to write their own data\ngenerating or analytic programs in C, Fortran, Pascal or Basic (though not\n186\nessential) can find easy-to-use algorithmic help in Cambridge University Press’s\nNumerical Recipes series (Press et al, 1991).\nThe conceptual and communication gaps between applied mathematicians\nand physicists and the bench practitioners of the neurosciences, that inevitably lead\none or the other, most often both, to surrender their deepest intuitions to jointly\nshared images that are inevitably more simplistic, are no longer inevitable. With her\nown hands on both the quantitative conjectural and experimental machinery, the\nmotivated practicing neuroscientist can honor her own insights, read about and\nconstruct symbolic representations from her intuitions and do her own quantitative\ntheory. Computerized numerical techniques have become so powerful and\naccessible that, even in academic settings, there is debate about whether\nfundamental analytic tools, such as series expansions, should be taught in\nundergraduate courses about differential equations.\nThe practice of “try it and see what happens\", with the current name of\nexperimental, computational mathematics, is accessible to all. In addition to the\npowerful general mathematical programs noted above, there exist several sets of\nmore specifically targeted software with the capacity to generate, portray and\nquantify the behavior of nonlinear continuous and discrete abstract and real\ndynamical systems. These often also include algorithmic modules that are useful in\ntailoring new models and measures (see for examples, Parker and Chua, 1989;\nBaker and Gollub, 1991; Nusse and Yorke, 1991; Sprott and Rowlands, 1991;\nSprott, 1993; Korsch and Jodl, 1994; Enns and McGuire, 1997). Learning from and\nusing this software, along with only a little programming in the high level languages\nand computer algebra programs listed above, permit the non-mathematician\nneuroscientist, willing to read in the literature such as that described below, to do\nindependent, cutting edge research in applied dynamical systems.\nDescribed below will be the computational discoveries in abstract systems\nand real neuroscientific data that have led to multiple contexts of quantitative\ndescription. These include those that are: (1) Geometric and conserve metric\ndistances; (2) Topological and conserve relative positions but not distances; (3)\nSingle or multiple global quantitative descriptors such as scaling numbers or scaling\n187\nnumber spectra; (4) Non-Gaussian distributions with heavy tails and correlations\nreflected in their Hurst, Fano, Allan and Levy exponents; (5) Statistical dynamical\ndescriptions of trajectories of the system in their embedding space such as\nLyapounov exponents, Hausdorff-Mandelbrot dimensions, Sinai-Ruelle-Bowen\nmeasures, and Adler-Weiss-Ornstein topological and metric entropies.\nCharacteristics which discriminate between experimental versus control\nconditions in parametric computational and real physiological and pharmacological\nexperiments serve to generate and test ideas and imagery arising out of behavior\nobserved in both biological and abstract dynamical realms. New experiments can\nbe suggested by the implicative structure of dynamical systems theory as well as\nneurobiological findings and intuitions. As examples, the sudden “switch” of manicdepressive\nbipolarity syndromes may be a “bifurcation” in nonlinear dynamical\nsystems; the “noise” of the statistical physicist may be the “arousal” of the brain\nstem-thalamic biogenic amine and reticular formation neurophysiologist; aspects of\n“thought disorder” in the pathophysiology of schizophrenic patients may be an\nentropic sequencing idiosyncrasy in the “symbolic dynamics” of a particular brain\nsystem attractor; neuronal “bursting” may be the “intermittency” of a neurodynamical\nsystem; a multiplicity of “discrete ion channel conductances” may be a single “global\nscaling hierarchy” of conductances times. The number of published examples of this\nfusion of ideas and methodology in the biological-relevant literature is already in the\nseveral hundreds and Medline counts indicate is growing exponentially.\nRepresentative samples of these are described below.\nIn addition to the technological advances in computational hardware and\nsoftware, the major scientific surprise making this new era possible is the discovery\nof universalities, the finite set of behaviors characteristic of most, if not all nonlinear\nsystems, across most if not all of the specific equations or neural systems being\nexplored. This makes the emergence of semi-quantitative equivalence relations\nbetween model and data not only possible but likely, even though we don’t now and\nperhaps never will know enough to either write or solve completely the specific and\ndetailed equations for the biological system of interest. We neuroscientists need not\nbe apologetic for using these ideas and tools qualitatively and empirically. In fact,\n188\nunanticipated results of analog and digital computer experiments were responsible\nfor most if not all of the discoveries underlying the current era’s revolution in applied\nnonlinear mathematics\n.\nModern Applied Dynamical Systems Emerged from Accidental\nComputational Discoveries\nA medical student named Herr, in his thesis research with the “radio\nengineer”, Van der Pol (1926), was simulating cardiac electrophysiology with an\nanalog device which permitted real time, exploration of a full range of parameter\nvalues long before there were fast enough digital processors to do so. Studying the\nbehavior of equations of a periodically, pace maker, driven, nonlinear triode\noscillator, Herr found orbital points that appeared to belong to two different periods\nsimultaneously thus violating the uniqueness of solutions of differential equation\ntheory. The Van der Pol relaxation oscillator equations, with their slow buildup and\nsudden discharge of membrane potential are good models for the slow-fast\nprocesses of repolarization and depolarization of Hodgkin-Huxley type equations\n(Rinzel, 1985). Periodically driven, nonlinear differential equations of the Van der\nPol type are generally applicable to the multiplicity of dynamical regimes of neuronal\ndynamics (Carpenter, 1979; Aihara et al, 1984; Chay and Rinzel, 1985) and, with\nperiodic and aperiodic driving and noise, can be made relevant to particular\nmammalian neuronal subsystems in the context of clinically relevant global\nelectrophysiological phenomena such as Magoun’s (1954) brain stem evoked EEG\nand behavioral arousal (Nicolis, 1986; Selz and Mandell, 1992; Mandell and Selz,\n1993).\nIn the early 1940’s, using the pre-publication results of similar analog\ncomputer studies (Levinson, 1949), the Cambridge mathematicians, Mary\nCartwright and Joe Littlewood (1945; McMurran, S., Tattersal, J.,1999) used\ngeometric methods to prove that the highly nonlinear, periodically driven Van der\nPol equations, depending upon one or two changing parameters, generated fixed\npoint (“homeostatic”), periodic (“cyclic”), subharmonic (“period doubling”),\nquasiperiodic (“multiply periodic”), intermittent (“bursting”) and “deterministically\n189\nrandom” patterns. We now know such phenomena to be universal characteristics of\nbifurcation scenarios in nonlinear dynamical systems where bifurcation means\ndiscontinuous changes in patterns of behavior (dependent variables) resulting from\nsmooth changes in parameters (independent variables). Alerted to their presence in\ncomputer experiments with biologically relevant nonlinear differential equations,\nthese phenomena have since been found in time series from patch clamped\nmembrane channels, single neurons, neuronal networks, neuroendocrine systems,\nbrain waves and patterns of behavior in animals and man (see below). Cartwright-\nLittlewood found that the inner and outer edges of the domains of attraction (all the\ninitial values that eventually wind up in the attractor—the limit set of all bounded\nsolutions) of two different sets of subharmonic periods for the same parameter\nsettings were interlaced at many scales in what is today called a fractal basin\nboundary. It was in this way that the specific values of the end state are understood\nto be indeterminate since the starting values in the fractal basin boundary are\nimpossible to isolate and specify with adequate experimental precision.\nSimilar biologically-relevant analog computer discoveries about the Van der\nPol and comparable periodically forced, dissipative (energy utilizing) Duffing\nequations (Zeeman, 1976) were made in the early 1960’s by electrical engineer,\nYoshi Ueda (1992), but his thesis director, Chihiro Hayashi of Japan’s Kyoto\nUniversity, was sufficiently disturbed by this evidence for the existence of bounded\nsolutions (attractors) that were neither fixed points (equilibria) nor periodic orbits\n(cycles), the only ones known at the time and therefore “strange,” that he refused to\nlet Ueda publish his findings until he did so as an independent investigator in the\n1970’s.\nIn the early 1960’s, Edward Lorenz (1963), a meteorologist and student of\nthe Harvard mathematician and dynamical systems pioneer, George Birkoff (1922),\nwas computing the output of a very reduced subset of Saltzman’s differential\nequations for predicting the weather (1962). Lorenz found that numerically\nintegrated trajectories manifested unpredictable times and directions of motion\nbetween the two spiral orbits of what has come to be known as the Lorenz attractor.\nVery small differences in starting values led to widely diverse final values, and, just\n190\nas importantly, far apart initial values could be found close together in the limit set.\nThis behavior was called “sensitivity to initial conditions” by David Ruelle (1978;\nRuelle and Takens, 1971). It is noteworthy, however, that over a range of values of\nthe parameters, the overall pattern of the orbits of the Lorenz attractor results in\ncharacteristic geometric pictures as well as invariant statistical descriptors.\nQualitative and quantitative global similarities were gained while specific solutions\nwere lost in these “strange attractors” of nonlinear systems. Analog computer\nsimulation of a simpler set of equations inspired by nonlinear chemical reaction\nkinetics led to the discovery by Rössler (1976) of another early and generic strange\nattractor combining sensitivity to initial conditions and characteristic geometries and\nmeasures.\nIt was the Russian mathematicians, A.N. Kolmogorov (1957), Sinai (1959)\nand V.I. Arnold (Arnold and Avez, 1968), the French mathematicians, Rene Thom\n(1972) and David Ruelle (1978) and the U.C. Berkeley mathematicians, Steve\nSmale (1967) and his student, Rufus Bowen (1975), and their associates who\ngathered together these and other related computational discoveries and embedded\nthem in a qualitative theory of nonlinear differential equations, using a variety of\nformalisms, including point set and differential topology, geometry, analysis and\nergodic (having an invariant statistical description) measure theory that formally\nestablished the fundamentals for research in nonlinear dynamical systems. Here a\ndynamical system refers generally and simply to the components and nonlinear\nprocesses (transformations) that move points (values) in discrete (“map”) or\ncontinuous (“differential equation”) time around in an appropriately defined space.\nThe phrase, “nonlinear transformation” in this context does not imply easily solvable\ncurved functions, such as those representing the sigmoid kinetic or threshold\nfunctions of enzymes and neuronal networks or those that smoothly log transform\nthe amplitudes of auditory or other sensory modalities in man, but rather allude to\nexpressions containing products, powers and functions of the computational and/or\n3\nexperimental variables , such as xx , ( x i\nor si n( x)\n.\nx i\n1 2\n)\n191\nAs noted above, the cross-disciplinary cohesiveness of such a vaguely\ndefined field occurred as the result of the unanticipated discovery of a relatively\nsmall set of nonlinear phenomena, universalities, that implicated many fields of\nmathematics, from differential geometry to number theory, and were found in a\nbroad range of physical and biological realizations, from turbulent plasmas and\nchemical and enzymatic reactions to neuroendocrine hormone release patterns. It is\nperhaps counter-intuitive but, whereas linear systems can generate an infinite\nnumber of solutions locating points anywhere the person writing the equations\nwants them to go, nonlinear systems are generally restricted to a finite set of global\ndynamics and these emerge on their own from the intrinsic dynamics of the system.\nTrying to make these systems follow orders, not unlike finding the most clinically\neffective dosage range of a psychopharmacological agent, require the empiricism of\ntrial and error experiments.\nA second class of computational accidents involving nonlinear systems\nresulted in unanticipated coherence rather than unpredictable disorder. Using one\nof the early “high speed” digital computers at Los Alamos, MANIC I, Enrico Fermi\nwith Pasta and Ulam (1955) attempted to obtain a many-body statistical\nthermodynamic equilibrium analogous to heat generated noise by coupling 64\nparticles together with nonlinear springs. They found only a few low period modes\nthat oscillated indefinitely. Instead of equidistribution of the energy into 128 degrees\nof freedom (64 locations × 64 velocities in 128 dimensional phase space), they\nfound it gathered up into only few coherent modes. Although the relevance to\nbiological science of nonlinear multifrequency coherence is a bit off from our focus,\nit is worthwhile noting that a recent (Karhunen-Loeve) decomposition of the alpha\nband of the resting alert human EEG revealed only three dominant temporal–spatial\nmodes: anterior-posterior, rotational and standing (Friedrich et al, 1991) and “few\nfrequency coherence” is a frontier of inquiry in brain wave research.\nA heterogeneous collection of coupled nonlinear elements in the form of\nwidely distributed, multi-location, multifrequency systems such as cross-cortical,\nbrain stem-thalamic-cortical and interconnected spinal motor neurons can generate\n192\ncoherent activity. This temporal and phase coherence plays an important role in\ncurrent theory of sensory-associative-motor integrative function, how distributed\nattributions come together in the brain representation of a single object or process,\nin the context of the so-called “binding problem” (Singer, 1993; Bressler, 1995;\nNicolelis, 1995; Schiff et al, 1997). Diffusely distributed neurochemical variables\nhave been invoked. For example, the role of metabotropic glutamate receptors in\ndriving the synchronization of interneuronal networks has been suggested as a\nmechanistic model (Whittington et al, 1995). The objects of relevance to the\ndiscovery of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam are studied as the nonlinear physics of\nnondissapative wave processes and are called solitons (Zabusky and Kruskal,\n1965). They have been invoked to model nerve conduction and information\ntransport in brain (Scott, 1990).\nA third counter-intuitive set of accidental computational findings is in an area\nof research called symbolic dynamics which involves the universal parameterdependent\ncoding language and capacity of nonlinear systems. In the early 1960’s,\na group around Stan Ulam at Los Alamos (Cooper, 1987) used one of the early\n“high powered” computers, MANIAC II, to iterate (letting the output of the action of a\ndiscrete time function serve as its input the next time around) simple equations they\ncalled “maps.” These reduced dimensional objects shaped like tents, sine functions\nand parabolas can be extracted from and represent the behavior of higher\ndimensional, nonlinear differential equations (see Devaney, 1989; Schuster, 1989 or\nMoon, 1992 for intuitive descriptions). They varied a parameter, such as the height\nof the tent or parabola, to systematically change the period and/or phase (order) of\nthe symbol sequence (Metropolis et al, 1973). Normalizing the range of values of\nthe output to [0,1] and transforming the series of values into a binary code, L ≤ 0.5\nand R > 0.5, they found an invariant, one parameter dependent, progression of\nordered periods, R, RLR, RLRR…RLLRL…, in all such single maximum maps. This\n“U (universal)sequence” has also been found as singly or multiply present in a\nvariety of real systems, including complicated chemical reactions (Simoyi et al,\n1982; Coffman et al, 1986). This means one can “dial” the parameter to generate\n“words” of sufficient computational complexity to serve as a language. These\n193\ncomputer experimental findings had already been anticipated in a remarkable\nmathematical proof by Sharkovskii (1964).\nThe dynamical richness of these simple, single maximum, one dimensional\nmaps was computationally explored in the context of ecological and epidemiological\nissues in the classical studies of Robert May (1976). It has been possible to relate\nthe individually characteristic L, R sequence behavior of human subjects on a\ncomputer task to a unique parameter of a tent map generating those sequences\nwhich predicted age and discriminated subclinical obsessive compulsive from\nborderline syndromes (Selz and Mandell, 1993). The dynamical entropy of\nunstructured L,R behavior also discriminated a population of schizophrenic patients\nfrom normals (Paulus et al, 1996). More generally, parameter dependent dynamical\ncoding, built into the universal behavior of its constitutive equations, is a mechanism\nwith which a nonlinear dynamical system, such as nerve membrane equations as\nabove, or in the aggregate, the middle layer of a completely connected neural\nnetwork, can encode, Morse code-like, messages (Paulus et al, 1989).\nBifurcations in Biologically Relevant Dynamical Systems\nBifurcations, “splitting into (two) branches,” are observed over a smooth\nchange in control parameter(s) (independent variables), as a discontinuous and\nqualitative change in the dynamical (time-dependent) pattern of the observable\n(Guckenheimer and Holmes, 1993; Wiggens, 1990; see Strogatz, 1994, for a\nparticularly intuitive description). Qualitative here means how the dynamics of the\ntrajectory appear as a geometric-topological (relative shaped not necessarily sized)\npattern in phase space. In such a space, the orbital points are located along the x-\naxis by their value, x at time t, and along the y-axis by their time rate of change at\nthat t, dx . To visualize a representative phase portrait in the plane, start by\ndt\nimagining the pattern made by mass hanging on a linear spring at rest as\ndx\nrepresented by a point centered at x = 0, y = = 0. When perturbed from rest, the\ndt\n194\nphase portrait of the motion of this “harmonic oscillator,” is composed of a\n(continuous) series of points representing its location, graphed along x , its rate of\nmotion graphed along , y =\ndx dx\n. x and\ndt dt\nco-localize the circular orbit as it speeds\nup and slows down while it bobs up and down. The transition from a fixed point (the\nmass at rest) to a circle (the bobbing mass), a bifurcation in phase space, results in\nthe loss of topological equivalence. That is, the phase space geometries before and\nafter the bifurcation cannot be smoothly distorted into each other. Continuity and\nconnectedness of the space is lost. For topological equivalence, stretching, bending\nand warping are allowed but not tearing apart and/or gluing together. Following the\nbifurcation of a fixed point into a circle, even limitless shrinking of the ring leaves a\nhole. The appearance or disappearance of an equilibrium fixed point (called a\n“saddle-node” bifurcation), splitting into two (“period doubling” bifurcation), its\nexploding into a circle (“Hopf” bifurcation to a limit cycle), a circle splitting into two or\nmore incommensurate cycles (“secondary Hopf” bifurcation) and these multiperiodic\n(“quasiperiodic”) dynamics breaking down into a recursive spirals (“homoclinic\nbifurcation to chaos”) are among the common bifurcations in nonlinear dynamical\nsystems, and all of them have been observed in many neurobiological settings.\nIn the forced-dissipative (energetically driven and energy consuming)\ndynamical systems relevant to the neurosciences---this characteristic contrasts with\nthe dissipation free momentum of the classical mechanics of astrophysical bodies---\nthere are four “most generic” bifurcation scenarios as a parameter changes that\nmay, but need not, lead to chaos (see below for definition) (for early and physically\noriented treatments see Eckmann, 1981; Ott, 1981; Berge′ et al, 1984, Kaneko,\n1983). These scenarios are: (1) Fixed point or cycle splittings into twice-as-long\nperiod lengths 1→2→4→8→16…called the subharmonic or “period doubling route”;\n(2) The transformation of fixed points to one and then more periodic orbits, multiple\nindependent (nonharmonic, incommensurate) frequency oscillations, their mode\nlockings and then breakdown called the “quasiperiodic route”; (3) Fixed point or\ncyclic equilibria metamorphosed into irregular bursting patterns called the\n“intermittency route”; and (4) In the context of quasiperiodic dynamics, adjacent\n195\nnonharmonic frequency encoding parameter spaces fusing, resulting in new periods\nthat are the sums of their adjacent ones: period 2 + period 3 = period 5, in what is\ncalled the “period adding route”. Technically precise classification of bifurcations\ninvolve much more careful definitions and well studied technical constraints\ninvolving such issues as the symmetries and dimensionality of the system of\nobservables, how many control parameters (“codimensions”) are required to\nreasonably realize the bifurcation and the particular way the fixed points of the\nsystem become unstable, all of which are directly explorable when the equations\nare known or can be hypothetically inferred from the qualitative behavior of real\ndata.\nWe note a few examples from the wide variety of bifurcating systems that\ncan be found in the biomedical literature of interest for the biological sciences. With\nsubstrate input rate as the bifurcation parameter, the phosphofructokinase regulated\nglycolytic cycle in yeast extract was found to change among steady state, periodic\nand period doubling (subharmonic) regimes (Boiteux et al, 1975). Transitions\nbetween steady state, oscillatory and chaotic patterns have been reported in variety\nof physiological measures in man including respiratory rhythms and circulating\nblood cell concentrations over time (Mackey and Glass, 1977; Glass and Mackey,\n1988 ) and models of dopamine cell dynamics (King et al, 1984). Flow rate\nparameter sensitive periodic, bursting and chaotic behavior has been found in a\nperoxidase-oxidase system (Olsen and Degn, 1977). A brain enzyme, substantia\nnigral dopaminergic tyrosine hydroxylase, manifested different saturation and\nfluctuation patterns, including bursting and periodicity, in experiments in which low\n(physiological) levels of tetrahydrobiopterin cofactor were the bifurcation parameters\nand adrenergic drugs were used as modulators (Mandell and Russo, 1981).\nAll four of the generic bifurcation routes to chaos, period doubling, changing\nmultifrequency (quasiperiodicity), period adding and bursting (called “intermittency”)\nwere observed in self-sustained oscillations induced in the neural membranes of\nspace clamped, giant squid axons that were immersed in a 550mM NaCl, and\nelectrically stimulated over changing amplitudes and frequencies (Aihara et al,\n1986; Takahashi et al, 1990). With external stimulus current level as the control\n196\nparameter, the R15 cell of the abdominal ganglion of the Aplysia demonstrates\ntransitions between bursting and periodic modes as well as period doubling, a\nsignatory period 3 and the Lyapounov characteristic exponent evidence (see below)\nfor the discontinuous onset of chaos (Canavier et al, 1990). Manipulating feed back\ndelay, the human pupillary light reflex will bifurcate into regular oscillations (Milton\nand Longtin, 1990). A transition between a regime of irregular discharging to\noscillatory bursting behavior was induced in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons by\nneurotensin (Alonso et al, 1994). Sympathetic nerve discharge in decerebrate,\nventilated cats demonstrated transitions between periodic, multiple periodic\n(quasiperiodic with changing ratios to the ventilation frequency) and subharmonic\nbehavior in response to inferior vena cava occlusion, vagotomy, aortic constriction\nand spinalization (Porta et al, 1996). Period adding bifurcations were induced by\nchanging calcium concentrations or the addition of a potassium channel blocker in\nthe “pacemaker” formed when (rat) sciatic nerve is chronically injured (Ren et al,\n1997). Changing levels of the L-type calcium channel antagonist, verapramil, alter\nthe pattern of vasomotion of rabbit ear arteries among sets of multiple independent\nperiods, “quasi-periodicity,” mode locking and chaos (De Brower, 1998). At critical\nintensity and frequency, flicker visual stimulation of the salamander generates a\npharmacologically modifiable period doubling bifurcation in their ganglion cells (one\nspike for every two flickers) which is also seen subjectively and in occipital lobe\nevoked potentials at critical frequencies in bright, full-field flickered humans (Crevier\nand Meister, 1998).\nQualitative and Quantitative Universality in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems\n“Universality” (see above) entered the parlance of physics in the context of\nthe statistical mechanics of phase transitions near their critical points (Stanley,\n1971; Stauffer, 1985; Yeomans, 1993) and has come to refer to the finite set of\ntransitions and quantities common to nonlinear systems arising in their\nneighborhoods. A common physical example is the triple point of water-ice-steam\non the temperature-pressure phase plane where a small change in temperature or\n197\npressure leads to a global qualitative change in physical state. Analogously, the loss\nof topological equivalence occurs at the fixed point that, for examples, splits into two\nor explodes into a cyclic orbit in phase space. The same critical point behaviors and\nquantities occur in a wide variety of specific processes and their equations, and they\nare independent of the way the trajectories first arrived in the fixed point\nneighborhood. Once the system enters the regime of critical behavior, the predictive\nsignificance of its dynamical history is lost. This may also be the case for emergent\npsychiatric disorder (Mandell et al, 1985; Mandell and Selz, 1992; Ehlers, 1995;\nPaulus et al, 1996; Huber et al, 1999).\nThere are diagnostic patterns of behavior when a nonlinear system is in a\nneighborhood of a potential bifurcation. They include sudden and/or large jumps\nresulting from a small change in experimental conditions, the appearance of big\nbaseline fluctuations (anomalously large variance), the lengthening of the time\nrequired to relax following evoked or spontaneous perturbation (‘”critical slowing”),\nthe same global change in state occurring at different values of the parameter when\nincreasing versus decreasing a parameter’s value (“hysteresis”), the existence of\nsome range of values of the observable that cannot be attained by manipulation of\nthe parameter (“inaccessibility”) and the availability of two or more distinct states in\nthe same parameter neighborhood (“modality”) (Thom, 1972; Arnold, 1984; Gilmore,\n1981). It is perhaps relevant to polydrug psychopharmacology and clinical\nmanagement that the higher the co-dimension (the greater number of effective\nparameters being manipulated), the greater the accessibility and control of selected\nstate stability becomes with respect to difficult to obtain behaviors. Examples of the\npotential advantages of simultaneous manipulation of multiple influences have been\ndeveloped for affect disorder and anorexia nervosa (Callahan and Sashin, 1987).\nAs evidence for the independence of critical behavior from specific history,\nthe qualitatively universal bifurcations along the four canonical routes to chaos\nmanifest dimensionless ratios of parameter and phase space geometries between\nbifurcations. These ratios are quantitatively universal. The formalisms that rescale\nthe distances from fixed points in parameter and observable spaces result in the\nsame picture across scale, a dilatational symmetry (also called self similarity or\n198\naffinity). They are called renormalization group equations, and, with respect to\nprediction, they replace any or all of the original specific predictive equations for the\nparticular system under study (Cvitanovic′, 1989). Whereas the U sequence and\ncritical point behaviors are manifestations of qualitative universality, these scaling\nnumbers are manifestations of quantitative universality. We discuss them here\nbecause their omnipresence in computationally realized differential equations as\nwell as physical and chemical experiments along with their quantitative specificity\n(with values in all systems as “constant” as π) constitute a most persuasive\nargument for the substantiality of modern dynamical systems approaches to brain\nand other biological research.\nThe physical and physiological requirements for manifestations of these\nuniversal bifurcation scenarios can appear to be remarkably minimal. In physics, for\nexample a full panoply can be observed in a “dripping faucet” (Shaw,1984).\nSimilarly, a small piece of extirpated and perfused myenteric or femoral artery will\ndemonstrate these transitions in vasomotion spontaneously and almost\nindependent of flow rate (Stergiopulos et al, 1998).\nFeigenbaum discovered that in dynamical systems manifesting a series of\nperiod doubling bifurcations, the ratio of the parameter value at which the next\nperiod doubling bifurcation occurred relative to the last one ≈\n1\n… and the ratio\n4.\n6692\nof the magnitude of the spawning point to the one spawned ≈ 2.5. (Feigenbaum,\n1979). By “rescaling” distances along a parameter value (see below) using what is\ncalled a “universal renormalization operator” the geometric situation around each\nbifurcation point (though of different absolute “size) remains relatively the same. In\nintermittent systems, burst length varies as the inverse square root of the distance\nof the value of the parameter from that value that elicited the fixed point (Manneville\nand Pomeau, 1980). The universal characteristic of the third common parametric\nroute to chaos, quasiperiodicity, is that the ratio of independent frequencies found\nmost resistant to mode locking and breakdown into chaos is, ω i\n= 1.618… the\nω\ni+1\nnumber to which the ratio of adjacent Fibonocci numbers converge (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,\n199\n21…) (Shenker and Kadanoff, 1982). Similar quantitative scaling properties were\nalso discovered in the parametric period adding route (Kaneko, 1983).\nAll of these scaling numbers have been found in experiments and in\nremarkable agreement with theory. Examples have been discovered in electronic\ncircuits, hydrodynamic and mercury flows, acoustic systems, laser dynamics and\noscillating chemical reactions (see Cvitanovic′, 1989, for representative list of\nreferences). Whereas qualitative evidence for all of these bifurcation scenarios have\nbeen found in brain relevant experiments, there is yet to be a bifurcating\nexperimental biological system with adequate precision across a sufficient range of\nmagnitudes such that quantitative universality could be demonstrated across a\nsufficient range of values to be convincing. We remind ourselves that in order to\nestablish a Fiegenbaum number, each period doubling bifurcation of the several\nrequired necessitates about a five-fold improvement in the experimenter’s ability to\nspecify the control parameter.\nUsing Invariant Measures of Dynamical Neurobiological Systems\nBefore the modern era of dissipatively forced (energy utilizing) dynamical\nsystems research, the known attactors of an experiment’s initial values resulted\nfrom their convergence onto either a fixed point or a limit cycle. An attractor can be\nregarded as a set which remains in bounded space and to which all orbits in this\nneighborhood converge (Milnor, 1985). Since by the rules of differential equations,\norbits are required to be both smooth (graphable without lifting the pencil) and\nunique (different trajectories don’t intersect since the point of intersection would no\nlonger be unique), the foundational Poincare-Bendixon theorem says that any such\norbit confined to a two dimensional phase space that doesn’t converge to a fixed\npoint must, no matter how long it irregularly wanders, must, eventually intersect with\nitself and then go around the same route again in a (perhaps very long) cycle. In\nmost neuroscience research as well, we have generally regarded our data as\nmanifesting either tolerable (or intolerable) fluctuations around mean values (fixed\n200\npoints) or more or less regular cycles. We analyze our “fixed point” data using\nquantities such as the mean and variance of distributional statistics and the cycle\ndata using the amplitude, frequency, cycle length and phase of trigonometric\nfunctions. In central tendency-oriented research, rare, very high amplitude events\nhave usually been considered aberrations and tossed, and imperfect periodic\nbehavior is treated by “cosiner analysis” as regular cycles contaminated by\nmeasurement or system noise. Whereas technically, chaotic dynamics must live in\ndimension greater than two (for orbits to be more than a fixed point or limit cycle,\nable to snake around without necessarily intersecting ), the Lorenz attractor has\ndimension just a little over two, our difficulties with establishing the “true”\nphysiological dimension of real biological observables (see below) makes such a\nconsideration more theoretical than practical.\nThe orbits of a forced-dissipative dynamical system in a parameter regime\nengendering chaos, converge onto an attractor which is neither a fixed point nor a\nlimit cycle, thus the origin of the name “strange attractor” (Ruelle and Takens,\n1971). It was James Yorke that first named these dynamics “chaos” (Li and Yorke,\n1975). The necessarily statistical properties of the chaotic orbits on strange\nattractors follow from the generic characteristics of their motions (see Shaw, 1981\nfor a still conceptually current, non-mathematical treatment). These kinds of\nstatistics are studied in a research context called the “ergodic theory of dynamical\nsystems” (Ruelle, 1979; Eckmann and Ruelle, 1985). Ergodic is a word used to\ncharacterize a system with (or without) a particular condition placed on its statistical\nmeasures: the existence of an invariant measure which is undecomposabile into\ntwo invariant measures and, equivalently (though not obviously) one in which the\ntime average equals its average in the geometric space into which it is embedded.\nOne may arrive at the same ergodic measure from studying a single very long orbit\nor from summing across many individual but shorter orbits. This ergodic\nequivalence is made possible due to the definitional existence of at least one\ninvariant statistical measure and the dynamics of the system which ideally include a\nuniformly, sequence disordering process called “mixing” (see below).\n201\nOf course, most real biological dynamics are not uniformly mixing and so are\nnon-ergodic, but we shall see that the ways they fail to be ergodic (and thus remain\nin the conceptual context of ergodic measures) are descriptively useful (Mandell\nand Selz, 1997a). The emergence of many statistical approaches to characterizing\nthese motions have been accompanied by the expected controversies about which\nis best or correct (see below) and have been applied to the problem of diagnosis\nand clinical discrimination in a variety of neuroscience settings. In ideal abstract\nchaotic dynamical systems called Axiom A (Russians called them “C systems”),\nwhere most mathematical theorems are proven (Smale, 1967), all these measures,\nif properly computed, are equivalent. In real life, as in the related case of ergodicity,\nthey are not, and since no single one is complete, the more (incomplete) measures\nwe use in our studies along with interest in the way that they differ, supplies more\nuseful information about the system. Though researching and elucidating the most\nreliable and valid ways of computing these measures are a valuable goal, the\ncurrent debates focused on the superiority of a single particular measure,\nconstructed in a particular way in relationship to issues of insoluble absolutes like\n“randomness” versus “deterministic chaos may not be particularly valuable for\nuncovering new characteristics and potential mechanisms underlying a specific set\nof real neurobiological observables.\nEmphasizing diversity and relevance to the clinical biological sciences, we\nnote that quantifying patterns in ergodic (non-ergodic) measures have aided: the\ndiscrimination between normal and abnormal opticokinetic nystagmus in neurology\npatients (Aeson et al, 1997); localizing a two year old subcortical stroke in an EEG\nof a patient with no other signs or neurological findings (Molnar et al, 1997); the\ndiagnosis of early (not late) multiple sclerosis, as a nonspecific long tract disorder,\nin patients with mild optical neuritis using cardiac rate dynamics (Ganz and\nFaustman, 1996); seizure prediction from minutes to hours before the event in\nwhich subthreshold, pre-phase transition spatial diffusion and oscillations in\ncharacteristic changes in these measures can be found (Martinerie et al, 1998;\nElger and Lehnertz, 1998; Pign et al, 1997; Iasemidis et al, 1990); using these\nmeasures on the EEG to differentially predict hereditary predisposition to alcoholism\n202\n(Ehlers et al, 1995); indicating the presence or absence of septic encephalopathy\n(Straver et al, 1998); using time series from jejunal manometry to discriminate\nobjectifiable somatic from psychological conversion related irritable bowel syndrome\n(Wackerbauer et al, 1998); analyzing time-dependent patterns in plasma hormone\nlevels to discriminate between the presence or absence of a functioning tumor\n(Hartman et al, 1994, Mandell and Selz, 1997a); automated differentiation of ataxic\nfrom normal speech (Accardo and Menulo, 1998); and discrimination of\ntemporomandibular joint dysfunction from normal patterns of chewing motions\n(Morinushi et al, 1998).\nStyles of Orbital Motions in Chaotic Dynamical Systems\nIn chaotic dynamics, in various specific ways, an initial hypothetical handful\nof points lined up along the trajectory and acted on over time by the nonlinear\ndifferential equation (“operator”), get out of order in an unpredictable way. Here the\nhypothetical handful can come from a statistical aggregate of initial conditions or\nfrom a single recursive orbit studied over long times. As noted above, ergodic\ntheorists call this getting out of order “mixing” and how and to what degree this\nhappens consumes many mathematical theorems but for purposes of brain\nresearch, it can be best described using a variety of statistical measures. For\nexample, visualizing the Lorenz attractor (see above) as a butterfly in phase space,\nthe points get out of order because as they spiral out (“stretching”) to the edge of\none wing and return (“folding”) to the unstable fixed point on the butterfly’s body\nwhence they either jump to some place on the other wing to spiral to its edge or\nreturn to the same wing to spiral out again. Which one of these is chosen is\nexquisitely sensitive to very small changes in where the trajectory started and very\nsmall fluctuations in where it returned to the unstable fixed point on the butterfly’s\nbody. In fact, specification of these locations is beyond the precision of any real,\nthermodynamically vulnerable system.\nChaotic trajectories on the Rössler attractor (see above) wind out (“stretch”)\nto the edge along the inside of a conch shell in phase space and then are mapped\n203\nback (“fold”) into the spiral unpredictably somewhere in a mixing mechanism that\nhas been called “displaced reinjection.” In the slow-fast oscillations of the forced van\nder Pol in the chaotic regime, points in the slow phase (“repolarization”) jitter around\nand step on each other’s heels, getting out of order while waiting on the ledge\nbefore jumping (“depolarization”) to the next slow phase (“repolarization”) at some\nunpredictable time, thus generating a variably irregular series of interspike intervals.\nStretching and folding are also responsible for getting points get out of order\nin the single maximum map of the unit interval (studied for universal qualitative and\nquantitative properties by May and Feigenbaum and others as described above).\nWith increases in parameter values, the parabolic hill function onto which the unit\nline has been stretched gets steeper, more stretched. Mapping points on the hill\nback onto the straight line of the unit interval results in what amounts to the line\nfolding back on itself. This stretching and folding eventually fills the line with points,\nbut their sequence, from end to end, gets shuffled like a deck of cards.\nAs described more generally above, points that start as neighbors may get\nseparated (“divergence along the attractor”) and those that start at a distance from\neach other may be thrown together (“compression back onto the attractor”). These\nexpanding and folding motions that characterize the chaotic behavior on strange\nattractors have been likened to the actions of a taffy puller (Rössler, 1976). It is in\nthis way that nearby points can separate without leaving the attractor. It is also the\ncase that once indistinguishably close but then separated points may be\ncompressed together again generating new, temporary (unstable) cycles of all\npossible period lengths. These unstable fixed points may be the most important\nfeature of chaotic systems from the standpoint of new ideas about brain\nmechanisms (Pei and Moss, 1996; So et al, 1997). This aggregation of unstable\nloops can occur from points fluctuating away and back to the attractor as well as\nduring the crowding of points at the turns after their stretching out on more linear\nparts of the flow. Under the mixing flow of a chaotic dynamics, it is also true that a\nsingle point eventually explores the entire attractor, no attractor location is\ninaccessible to it.\n204\nAlthough counter-intuitive when expressed in words, the trajectories that one\nsees in the graphics of chaotic attractors result from the actions along the “unstable”\ndirections of the stretching distortion; the actions in the otherwise invisible stable\ndirections “iron down” the points onto this unstable manifold (n dimensional abstract\nsurface).\nAs might be expected from this set of characteristic motions, the diagnostic\ntriad of chaotic dynamical systems are: (1) Sensitivity to initial conditions—tiny\ndistances between starting points are magnified and large distances between\nstarting points are reduced under the stretching and folding actions of the system;\n(2) The presence of a theoretically infinite but countable number of unstable\nperiodic orbits of theoretically all period lengths—points in phase space can be\nviewed an attractive-repellers, visited and left by the orbits recursively as the\ndynamics proceed; and (3) Indecomposability—the attractor is not separable into\nisolated regions and no points escape (see Devaney, 1989, for one of the clearest\ndefinitions). Of particular relevance to information encoding and transport by brain\nmechanisms, it is important to visualize that new information in the form of unstable\nperiodic orbits is being created as well as destroyed by the dynamics. The\nlogarithmic rate of formation of these new orbits is computed as the system’s\ntopological entropy (see below).\nAssuming the real neurobiological system under study is behaving in these\nways (and often much has to be done to help justify such a claim), the observables\ntake the form of an irregular and/or episodic time series of amplitudes, as in\nrepeated sample, neuroendocrine studies of plasma hormone levels (Veldhuis and\nJohnson, 1992) or a sequence of times between events as in neuronal interspike\nintervals (Katz, 1966; Perkel et al, 1967). These time or time-sequence series are\ngenerally studied from three relatively distinct yet complementary quantitative\nperspectives: (1) As stochastic (“random”) processes with various amounts of\nsequential dependency (autocorrelations) and scale (sample length) dependencies;\n(2) As “deterministic” smooth or discrete, vectorial geometries in phase space\nfollowing reconstruction and/or embedding of the series as phase portraits or return\nmaps; (3) As information generating and transporting, topological (about relative\n205\nnearness and sequential order not absolute distances), symbolic dynamical\nprocesses which as either (1) or (2) can be analyzed with respect to its various\nentropies, algorithmic complexities and word content and syntax. A variety of\ntechniques aimed at deciding between the relevance of one or another of these\nunderlying assumptions (such as series and Fourier phase shuffling to destroy\nstatistical autocorrelations and vectorial continuities but leaving the probability\ndensity distributions intact ) may at times help emphasize one or another of these\norientations in the analyses (see Ott et al, 1994 for a collection of articles on this\ntopic).\nNonconvergent Distributions and Power Law Scaling in Biologically Relevant\nTime Series\nThe statistical distribution with which most of us are familiar is the Gaussian\nwhich can be generated by summing and averaging a series of independent\nrandom events. The average behavior head/tails probabilities observed by one\nperson flipping a fair coin for a very long time or by many people flipping similar\ncoins for shorter times converges upon the invariant measure of 0.5. The variance,\n“second moment” in the distribution of a population of coin flipping sequences will\nbe finite and computable. In a graph of this distribution, the tails will converge to the\nx axis in a Gaussian exponential manner. The longer or the more numerous the\n“sample” series of observations, the closer they will approximate the “ergodic”\ninvariant measures representing the true “central moments” of the behavior of this\n“population” of fair flipping coins. Since the coins are not changing their relevant\ncharacteristics over the time of observation, we say that the series is not time\ndependent but instead is “stationary.” Computation of correlations over increasing\nlags to determine how much and for how many flips the sequences continue to\nresemble themselves yield an exponential decay with a single characteristic\ncorrelation length. This reflects the existence of a finite variance from which its\namplitude is derived and serves as the single characteristic temporal scale of the\nrandom process.\n206\nBefore describing the relatively new set of measures of biological processes\ndesigned to find and quantitate what are assumed to be relatively sample size\ninsensitive, distributionally nonconvergent and multiply correlated processes that\nare without a single time or space scale, we should remind ourselves that there is\nalready much more apparent “order” in a generically random situation than our\nintuitions would lead us to believe. For example, if we keep cumulative scores in a\ncompetition between heads and tails and determine the distribution of trials between\nthose in which the number of heads and tails are even, we will get periods between\nzero crossings of many lengths with very short ones and very (very) long ones\nbeing most statistically prominent. The distribution of these wavelengths is shaped\nlike a symmetrically fat-tailed, bowl (Feller, 1968). As another illustration, expected\nruns of heads or tails in this Gaussian random task are longer and more frequent\nthan we might suspect. It has been proven that the expected run length grows with\nn coin flips (as an order of magnitude estimate) like the logarithm (for a fair coin,\nbase 1/p = 1/0.5 = 2) of n. For example, in 512 ( e.g. 2 9 ) tosses, we cannot report a\nrun of 9 heads as a evidence for a biased coin or the sign of some deterministic\ncoin tossing mechanism (Erdos and Renyi, 1970). If we had a 0.6 head biased coin,\nthen the observation of a run of 13 heads couldn’t dissuade us from a random\nmechanism!\nUnlike our random coin task, the variances of many, perhaps most, time\nseries of biologically-relevant events, do not tend to converge onto a limiting value\nas sample size, n, grows, but rather continue to increase (or decrease) with n in a\nscale invariant manner. Instead of “regressing to the mean” with increasing sample\nlength or number, the likelihood of a larger deviation than previously observed\nincreases with n. Analyses of inter-event intervals reveals a multiplicity of\ncharacteristic times. One interpretation of these finding might be that this represents\nevidence for the inherent “nonstationarity” of biological mechanisms as reflected in,\nfor examples, the frequency of saccades concomitant with ceaselessly shifting foci\nof visual attention (Steriade and McCarley, 1990), or our inability to not think of\n“white bear” when so instructed (Wegner, 1994). Hermann Haken, the father of\nlaser-inspired “synergetics,” has said that biological mechanisms are not in a steady\n207\nstate for very long, spontaneously and irregularly jumping from one unstable\ndynamical state to another (1997). This suggests that meaningful tension between\nexperimental sample lengths long enough to minimize statistical error and short\nenough to be stationary may be, for the biological sciences, more apparent than\nrelevant.\nThe studies reviewed below exploit measures arising from the view that the\nnoisy statistics of nonstationarity in biological processes are not a sign of\nmeasurement error, but rather evidence consonant with the statistical physics of\nnonequilibrium states and phase transitions (Stanley, 1971; Stauffer, 1985;\nYeomans, 1993). Very high amplitude fluctuations and multiple, up to infinite,\ncorrelation lengths are characteristic of the normal, on-going biological dynamical\nbehaviors, which are apparently without characteristic amplitude and time scales.\nFrom this point of view, if most or all information is widely distributed in the brain\n(e.g., serial order of visual tasks involving motor cortical neurons, Carpenter et al,\n1999) ) then the “binding problem” (see above) could also be solved by multiple, up\nto infinite spatial and temporal correlation lengths in place of the current theories of\nmonofrequency resonances (Singer, 1993). Hierarchical neurodynamical\nmechanisms communicating across many mechanistic temporal and spatial scales,\nbrain information transport analogous to the energy cascade of hydrodynamic\nturbulent velocities (Tennekes and Lumley, 1972), would be likely in the parametric\nvicinity of incipient bifurcations and phase transitions.\nThree closely related techniques for quantifying the systematic changes in\naverage fluctuation amplitudes with n (scale, sample length) involve a “power law,”\nlinear slope relationship between the logarithm of an index of variability and the\nlogarithm of sample segment sizes. These easy, yet powerful methods were\nbrought to experimentalists’ attention by Benoit Mandelbrot (Montroll and Badger,\n1974; Mandelbrot, 1983; Fedor, 1988; Bassingthwaighte et al, 1994; Liebovitch,\n1998). To estimate the exponent in Hurst rescaled range analysis, we compute the\nstandard deviation and the range of the deviation of the running sum from the mean\non sequential subsamples of increasing size. The Hurst power law exponent is the\nslope of the straight line formed by graphing the logarithm of the subsample length\n208\nalong the x axis and the logarithm of the ratio of the range to the standard deviation\non the y axis. An independent random system has a Hurst of 0.5. If a sequential\nincrease or decrease in an amplitude or inter-event time tends to be followed by a\nchange in the same direction, the Hurst > 0.5. If an increase in the measure tends\nto be followed by a decrease, then Hurst < 0.5. Computation of the Fano factor\n(power law exponent) exploits the same general strategy using the variance/mean\nin place of the range/variance and counting the number of events (such as single\nneuron discharges or heartbeats) in time windows of increasing length, generating a\nsimilar log-log graph. There is a relatively long history of the use of spike-number\nvariance-to mean ratio in studies of response variability in visual cortical neurons\n(see Teich et al, 1996 for a review). The Allen factor (power law exponent) tends to\nreduce the influence of local trends by a computation of the variance of the\ndifference between the number of events in two successive time windows divided\nby twice the mean number of events in the window.\nEach system’s invariant logarithmic slope across sample segment sizes\ntakes the place of its missing finite variance in characterizing experimental data in\nwhich the distributional tails do not converge (or do so very slowly) to the x axis.\nRecent approaches to these measures in the context of stochastic analysis of DNA\nsequences, but also applied to normal and pathological cardiac inter-beat intervals\nand gait interval sequences, have dealt with the influence of non-stationarity due to\napparent trends in the data on α-equivalent indices by local mean-normalization of\nthe fluctuations at each window size (Peng et al, 1993; Peng et al, 1995; Hausdorff\net al, 1995).\nThe rate of decay of the densities in the tails of the probability distribution as\nthey approach extreme values along the x axis, called the Levy exponent when\nrepresented in Fourier space (technically, as a “characteristic function” of the\nprobability distribution) (Shlesinger, 1988; Shlesinger et al, 1995), can also be\ncomputed directly on the distribution by fitting the tails with a two parameter curve\nquantifying their “fatness” and rates of decay (Mantegna, 1991). We can speak of a\nGaussian tail as having an exponential decay rate representable by α = 2 implying\n209\nfinite variance. A tail with a nonconvergent decay rate of 1 < α < 2 indicates nonfinite\nvariance in the data such that the usual “normal curve” derived, standard\ndeviation dependent tests of statistical significance are without meaning. α < 1\nindicates the data is without a consequential mean and will require the use of\ninterquartile measures to locate the center of the distribution (Adler et al, 1998).\nRecalling that the Hurst, Fano and Allan indices are invariant across sample\nsegment size, we remind ourselves that, as is the case in the finite mean and\nvariance, α = 2, Gaussian, any of the other “α tails” also retain their value (“shape”)\nacross all partitions that might be used to sort and sum the observable. This\nproperty is called convolutional, α, stability. In passing it should be noted that the\nlast outpost of convergence of a probability density distribution with α = 2 is called\n“log-normal,” in which the tails along the x axis are “pulled in” by the variable being\nplotted as its logarithm.\nA Hurst exponent of > 0.5 in the data is associated with a Levy exponent of <\n2.0, and both would be indicative of a process in which the characteristic style of\nchange, rather than decay with some finite correlation length, would persist across\nall time. Using a bursting neuron as a generic example, a short interspike interval\nwould, on the average, be followed by another short one and a long one by another\nlong one, and this behavior, unlike our fair coin flipping sequence of observables,\nwould not become uncorrelated with itself even over infinite time. Another way to\nrepresent this infinite, innumerably lengthed, correlation property is via its implicate\nfrequency (inverse wavelength) content by computing its best fit assortment (along\nwith their densities) of a range of short to long sine waves forming the Fourier\ntransformation of the correlation function. The condition of correlated fluctuations\nacross many measured temporal scales yields yet another power law slope when\ngraphed as the logarithm of its range of frequencies, f, plotted along the x axis,\nversus their corresponding amplitudes squared, powers, plotted along the y axis.\nNaming this spectral power law exponent β, the system’s characteristic scaling law\nis usually expressed as 1 (Fedor, 1988; Hughes, 1995; Shlesinger, 1996;\nβ\nf\n210\nLiebovitch, 1998).\nWe see that the Hurst exponent, Fano and Allen factors, Levy exponent and\npower spectral scaling exponent are kindred statistical descriptors. They are most\nusefully applicable to systems with distributions that fail to be Gaussian or\nasymmetrically Poisson, the latter from random data sequences with only positive x\nvalues, thus backed up toward zero by a minimum inter-event interval or amplitude.\nThese time series are sequentially dependent, not conventionally stationary, without\nfinite central moments and with self-correlations that don’t demonstrate Gaussian\nexponential decay with sample length or time. The following are some examples of\nthe use of these measures in studies of biological dynamics. .\nExamples of Biological Data with Divergent Distributions and Power Law\nScaling\nA paradigm challenging group of experiments involved models and measures\nof the distribution of characteristic open and closed times of membrane ion\nconductance channels. The usual approach to this problem assumed the existence\nof a small set of distinguishable channel types that were reflected in discrete\nconductance events with a small set of characteristic open and closed times. The\ndistributions of each of could be fitted with its own, Markov process derived,\nexponential. With technical advances and improved temporal resolution, more\ncharacteristic times and their associated α = 2 exponentials were reported with as\nmany as three not being unusual. Liebovitch (and Sullivan,1987; 1989) used\nanalogue to digital transformation of current recordings from the unselective corneal\nepithelial channels and voltage dependent potassium channels in cultured mouse\nhippocampal cells at temporal resolutions ranging from 170 to 5000 Hz and found\nsimilarly shaped, α < 2, nonconvergent distributions across temporal scales. This\nled these investigators to suggest that, related to the >16 recorded magnitudes of\ncharacteristic times, from picoseconds to months, in autonomous protein motion\n(Careri et al, 1975; Gurd and Rothgeb, 1979), that there was an “α stable” hierarchy\n211\nof lifetimes of states, observable at almost any temporal resolution that methods\nwould allow.\nEarly and representative studies comparing the fit of the data with\nhierarchical scaling functions versus a sum of a small number of Markovian\nexponentials included studies of a calcium activated potassium channel in human\nfibroblasts (Stockbridge and French, 1989) which yielded evidence to support both\nmodels, as did studies of membrane conductances in corneal epithelial cells by\nanother group (Korn and Horn, 1988). In a systematic comparison of scaling and\nMarkov exponential modes of the gating kinetics of GABA activated chloride\nchannels, acetylcholine activated end plate potentials, calcium activated potassium\nchannels and fast chloride channels (McManus et al, 1988), it was found that the\nlatter fit the data best in most experiments. Similar results were reported in studies\nof the glutamate and delayed rectifier potassium channel with respect to\ndistributions of open and closed times (Sansom et al, 1989). Space does not permit\na systematic account of the continuing debate and conflicting studies about these\nrepresentations and the implicit biophysics of discrete, finite versus continuous,\nhierarchical channel event heterogeneity. It is interesting that recent experiments\nmaking use of Hurst rescaled range analyses of time series of whole cell membrane\nvoltage fluctuations (without the assumptions and current renormalizing procedures\nassociated with patch clamping) have yielded additional evidence for multiply\ncorrelated, Hurst > 0.5, α < 2 power law behavior of what some might regard more\ngenerally as a protein relaxation time mediated hierarchical array of ion\nconductance behaviors (Liebovitch and Todorov, 1996).\nFollowing the discovery of (very) subsaturating (“far from equilibrium”) rat\nbrain levels of the common cofactor for tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases,\ntetrahydrobiopterin (Bullard et al, 1978), studies of amino acid substrate saturation\nfunctions and time courses determined at these low, physiological co-reactant\nconcentrations manifested patterns of hierarchical multiplicity and discontinuities\nsuggestive of bifurcations and time-dependent fluctuations with fractional\n(hierarchical) time scaling exponents that were sensitive to psychotropic drugs\n212\n(Mandell and Russo, 1981; Knapp and Mandell, 1983; Russo and Mandell, 1984a;\nRusso and Mandell, 1986). Similar bifurcating and power law kinetics were found in\nreceptor-ligand binding systems (Mandell, 1984) which were confirmed by more\nrecent studies of diffusion-limited binding kinetics with receptors immobilized on a\nbiosensor surface (Sadana, 1998). Hierarchical kinetics have also been reported in\ntime courses of drug and metabolite levels (Koch and Zajcek, 1991), tissue tracer\nwashout studies (Beard and Bassingthwaighte, 1998), carrier mediated transport\nprocesses (Ogihara et al, 1998), general pharmacokinetic functions (Macheras et al,\n1996) and biochemical networks (Yates, 1992). It is likely that bifurcating and\nhierarchical, power law kinetic functions will be studied more commonly in the\nchemical literature in general (Shlesinger and Zaslavsky, 1996; Berlin et al, 1996)\nas well as applied to a variety of protein-mediated biological functions (Dewey,\n1997).\nThe first demonstration of and stochastic model for nonconvergent\ndistributions of interspike intervals of a single neuron was by Gerstein and\nMandelbrot (1964). Though rich with possibilities, it has been only very recently that\nadditional work from this point of view has been published. This is likely due to the\nfact that most neuroscience oriented statistical packages, with rare exceptions, are\nwithout techniques for computing descriptive parameters for these divergent\nprobability density distributions. This has not been the case for economic time\nseries, download STABLE from http:///www.cas.american.edu/~jpnolan. Recently,\napplications of the Fano and Allan factor as well as power spectral scaling\nexponents to observed and shuffled series of spike counts and interspike intervals\nin the auditory and visual systems (including spatial and/or time resolved single unit\nrecordings in retinal ganglion, lateral geniculate and lateral superior olivary cells as\nwell a auditory nerve fibers) demonstrate the characteristic behavior of\nnonconvergent, hierarchical stochastic systems (Teich, 1989; Teich et al, 1990;\nLowen and Teich, 1992; Kumar and Johnson, 1993; Kelly et al, 1996; Teich et al,\n1997). These statistical techniques are well suited to the characterization of the\nirregularly intermittent bursting patterns generic for activity in single neurons as well\n213\nas in nonlinear equations representing them and other brain processes (Mandell,\n1983).\nAn early study of power spectral scaling in the EEG reported alpha band\nfluctuations that extended a 1 , β ≈ 1 pattern to 0.02 Hz (Musha, 1981), as did\nβ\nf\nother applications of the log-log power spectrum to the EEG in man (Hu and Hu,\n1988; Prichard, 1992). This power law scaling led naturally to the suggestion that\nthe range of frequencies available in the electromagnetic signal from the calivarial\nsurface extends far beyond those currently appreciated and may be available for\nstudy using relatively noise free recording techniques such as the\nmagnetoelectroencephalogram (Mandell and Selz, 1991). A not surprising range of\nintrinsic correlation lengths reflected in Hurst > 0.5 and/or Levy exponents < 2 have\nbeen reported in lamb fetal breathing patterns (Szeto et al, 1992). The exponent\nhas been shown to be sensitive to maternal alcohol intake in humans (Akay and\nMulder, 1998), rat neonatal motoric activity (Selz et al, 1995), and nuchal atonia\nduration sequences (associated with putative intra-uterine REM sleep) in fetal\nsheep (Anderson et al, 1998).\nSequential amplitudes in 1 Hz stimulated soleus spinal cord H-reflex\ndemonstrated a 1 , β ≈ 0.83 in control subjects and, reflecting the decrement in\nβ\nf\ncorrelations, by 0.31 in patients with losses in supraspinal input from spinal cord\ninjury (Nozaki et al, 1996). Whereas the sequences of fixation times in eye\nmovements of normal control subjects reading difficult material demonstrated an\nexponentially decaying distribution, those of schizophrenic patients demonstrated a\npower law tail, consistent with more sequential correlations (Yokoyama et al, 1996).\nThis finding may be related to the appearance of velocity arrests, runs of sticky fixed\npoints, in a spatially oscillating target task, called “smooth pursuit eye movement\ndysfunction” in schizophrenic patients which has been modeled as a parametric\ndisorder in a periodically driven nonlinear dynamical system (Huberman, 1987). The\n“short time fractal dimension” has been used to discriminate acoustic signal\ntransformations from the speech of normal subjects and ataxic patients (Accardo\n214\nand Mumolo, 1998). Spontaneous changes in the apparent syllabic sound made by\nregularly presented, word-like auditory stimuli emerge irregularly, the duration of\nperceived sameness demonstrating a power law distribution of “dwell” times (Tuller\net al, 1998). The same kind of power law distribution of characteristic “brain times”\ncan be found in studies of gait cycle durations in normal walking (Hausdorff et al,\n1996) with a decrease in this locally detrended, α-like index compared with controls\n(0.91±0.05) in patients with the basal ganglia disorders of Parkinson’s (0.82±0.06)\nand Huntington’s (0.60±0.04) Diseases (Hausdorff et al, 1998). Hurst > 0.5 has\nbeen speculated to more accurately quantitate the fundamental time structure of\ncells that was previously called circahoralian (ultradian) intracellular rhythms\n(Brodski, 1998).\nReconstructions of Time Series as Orbital Geometries\nRene Thom (1972), extending the ideas of Poincaré and D’Arcy Thompson\n(1942), argued that experimentally useful, intuitive connections between the\nqualities of biological processes and the quantities of an explicit (equations known)\nor implicit (equations unknown) dynamical system could be best achieved through\nthe use of graphic representations of their geometric and topological forms. Notably\nsuccessful examples can be found in the work of Thom, Arnold (1984) and Zeeman\n(1977), who were inspired by “caustics” (the shapes made on surfaces by the\ncoincidence of reflected or refracted light rays) and Whitney’s representation of\nparametric manifolds (surfaces) by the shadows they would make on a plane when\nback lit (Whitney, 1955). This led to a small number of qualitatively predictive,\nnumber-of-independent-parameters dependent shapes, such as “folds” “cusps” and\n“wavefronts.” Experimentally crossing the values of these independent variable\nforms at their singular boundaries successfully predicted discontinuities in the\notherwise smooth alterations in the dependent variable; i.e. bifurcations\n(“catastrophes”) in the behavior of the observable. This approach was best suited to\nthe study of systems with many independent variables and one dependent variable\nthat could be mapped on the axis of the latter to represent a continuum of\n215\noperationally defined “energy states.” Smooth changes along the path of the\nnonlinear parameter manifold generated discontinuous changes in energy levels\nindicating states of the observable. Crossing a wrinkle in an “independent variable”\n(some call it “order parameter” to indicate its emergence rather than availability for\npredictable manipulation) such as the nonlinear parameter surface of the\ncountervailing influences of survival fear and financial cost, may lead to a bifurcation\nin behavior from peace (“low energy”) to war (“high energy”) (Zeeman, 1977).\nIn a similar geometric spirit but dealing with nonequilibrium systems in\nmotion, the conditions such that one could “smoothly” embed a trajectory like a\ncontinuously recorded EEG record, a complicatedly coiled snake into a three or\nhigher dimensional box without loss of its essential dynamical or statistically\nmeasureable properties, was settled by Whitney in what is now referred to as the\n“embedding theorem” (Whitney, 1936). Starting with a tangled knot of overlapping\nvectorial orbits with apparent “non-invertable points” (given a point, one cannot\nchose among or between the more than one point that it apparently came from), it\ncan always be unwrapped into a non-crossing trajectory satisfying uniqueness when\nreconstructed in a box of a little more than twice the parameter-determined\ndimension of the original space of observables.\nA common technique for the spatial reconstruction of the output of a\ndynamical system is called a “time delay embedding.” This approach, first\nsuggested by Ruelle (1987, pg. 28) replaced the value, x, versus the time\nderivative, dx , phase portrait plot described for a continuously perturbed bob on a\ndt\nspring above. A sequence of observables over time, in, for example, three\ndimensional “phase space” (Packard et al, 1980; Takens, 1981; Sauer et al, 1991),\nis depicted by a curve representing the system’s trajectory at times t 1 , t 2 , t 3 , by\nsliding one-by-one down the series and plotting each p 1 , p 2 , p 3 , location with\nrespect to each other along the x, y and z axes respectively. The choice of time\ninterval between the points, the delay, can be delicate and usually some standard\nfraction of the decay time of the sequence’s autocorrelation length, “the decay time\nof mutual information” is chosen. There are many technical considerations,\n216\nincluding those involving the choice of the embedding space vis a vis the “true”\ndimension of the attractor. This becomes an issue when, for example, the attractor\nshrinks over time to some subspace of the initial embedding (Liebert et al, 1991 and\nreferences therein).\nIf we imagine the process of time series reconstruction to inscribe an\nattractor’s untidy ball-of-string of recurrent trajectories in three dimensions, we can\nthen, by making the z-dimension a constant value, cut the ball with a two\ndimensional plane, a “Poincaré surface of section.” This could yield a roundish\ncloud of discrete points on the x,y plane and t n-1 – t n would be the time between two\npiercings of this surface. It has been proven that almost any cut, as long as it is\nmade transverse to the direction of the orbital trajectories, is equally valid and useful\nfor further analyses (Oseledec, 1968). If the original embedding and subsequence\nsection was in high enough dimension to allow invertability, we might have enough\n(trial and error) knowledge to be able to write a discrete equation, a “return map,” f,\nf\nthat would move one point to the next on the plane as (x,y) t ←→ ⎯ (x,y) .\nWhat can sometimes be case with real systems (Coffman et al, 1986), is that\nreducing the geometric reconstruction still one dimension further, accepting noninvertability,\nironing down the points in the plane onto the x axis line (normalized to\n[0,1]), and plotting the values at x t against x t+1 (“mapping the unit interval to itself”),\ncan generate points in the general shape of a parabola with dynamics representable\nby the same family of one parameter, single maximum discrete equations that\ngenerated May's sequence of bifurcations, Feigenbaum’s scaling and Metropolis,\nStein and Stein’s (and Sharkovskii’s) U sequence (see discussions of qualitative\nand quantitative universalities above).\nAlthough sometimes a significant change in brain system physiology, such as\npenicillin-induced epileptic neuron spiking activity is revealed simply by a change in\nthe graphic appearance of suitably embedded time series data (Zimmerman and\nRapp, 1991), more often statistical measures made on the geometric dynamics of\nthe points on the attractor are required.\nn−1\nt n\n217\nOrbital Divergence Characterizes Expansive Dynamics on Biological\nAttractors\nIn the dynamical world of equilibria (fixed points in phase space) and\nperiodic cycles (fixed points of a return map), a common concern involves their\nstability. What happens if an adventitious jiggle moves the orbit a little distance\naway from the fixed point? Would the wind wiggled suspension bridge start to flap\nwith increasing amplitude or would it damp back down quickly to its stable state. A\n“Lyapounov functional,” L, is constructed which can be visualized like a smooth\npotential bowl around the fixed point such that any L stable solution that starts at its\nbottom tends to stay there or is asymptotically L stable if the solution converges to\nthe fixed point at the bowl’s bottom as t → ∞ . If the point is not L stable, it is L\nunstable.\nThe modern study of nonlinear systems have produced another kind of\nstability issue with a similar appellation yielding other direction specific indices, the\nLyapounov characteristic exponents, λ (Oseledec, 1968; Eckmann and\nRuelle,1985; Ruelle, 1990; Ott et al, 1994). In this context, the instability is not one\nof perturbative escape from a fixed point, but of the average rate with which the\n(theoretically infinitesimal) distances among a handful of points representing a set of\ninitial conditions (each a precision limited, hypothetical repetition of the same\nexperiment), are being stretched apart by the expansive action of a strange attractor\nsystem. In three dimensions, one can envision a ball of initial conditions being\nelongated along the unstable direction and ironed down from both sides along the\nstable direction over time, transforming the ball into an ellipsoid and then into a\n(recurrent) curve. In simplest terms and thinking about a one dimensional scalar\ntime series, the Lyapounov exponent reflects the multiplicative average (logarithmic\naddition) of the sequence of slopes of the series of straight lines connecting the\npoints. An average slope of > 45 ° is expansive such that a linear distance on the x-\naxis is increased when mapped onto the y axis. A slope of < 45 ° is a contraction\nmapping reducing the linear distance of the x-axis when mapped to the y axis.\n218\nRössler’s generic chaotic system (see above) moving recurrently in a three\ndimensional box can be orthogonally decomposed into three directional motions in a\nmoving frame, each with a signatory sign of λ . The unstable direction of expansive\nstretching is characterized by some number > 0, λ( + ), the stable direction of\ncontractive folding, some number, < 0, λ( − ), and the neutrally stable direction of\nrecurrence, λ( 0 ). For The “Lyapounov spectrum” of the Rössler attractor is\n[ λ( + ), λ( −), λ( 0 )] (Shaw, 1981). An n-dimensional dynamical systems has n onedimensional\nLyapounov exponents, and it is sometimes the case in relatively noise\nfree, finite semi-stationary data lengths of the neurosciences, that a λ > 0 can be\nshown to exist for a second one, in a dynamical situation called “hyperchaos” by\n(Rossler, 1979). For example, two and sometimes three λ( + ) have been reported in\nthe flows on the EEG attractor of normal alert subjects (Gallez and Babloyantz,\n1991). The presence of measurement noise, the finiteness of neurophysiological\nsample lengths as well as the relatively small expansive actions in some directions\nin the chaotic attractors of brain dynamics lead to the finding that most often, only\none “leading Lyapounov exponent,” λ( + ), is reliably computable (Sano and\nSawada, 1885; Wolf et al, 1985; Eckmann et al, 1986).\nA counter-intuitive fact about the stability of a dynamical system when a\ndecrease in the value of λ( + ) is observed such that λ( + ) → λ( 0 ), is that this more\nneutral stability augers a global bifurcation (Guckenheimer and Holmes, 1983). A\nsmall perturbation does not change the global dynamics of an already expanding\nand contracting (called “hyperbolic”) dynamical system, it will maintain the style of\nits motions. However, when λ( + ) → λ( 0 ), a velocity changing perturbation evokes a\nbifurcation to a new dynamic in what is called “loss of hyperbolic stability.” The best\nexamples come from the observations of this kind of change in the EEG predicting\nthe onset of epileptic seizures in patients with focal or temporal lobe epilepsy\n(Iasemidis et al, 1988,1990; Iasemidis and Sackellares, 1996 ).\n219\nThe number and variety of algorithmic strategies for computing Lyapounov\nexponents that are applicable to real data divide naturally into those that compute\ndirectly the average rate of separation of neighboring points from the “fiduciary”\norbit, as observed on the reconstructed attractor, from which only the largest λ can\nbe obtained (Wolf et al, 1985), and a variety of techniques based on assumed\nmodel maps of the unknown flow along which the sequential products of the local\nderivatives are computed. The logarithms of the straight line slopes of the sequence\nof directionally decomposed local tangent vectors multiplied, yield as many\nLyapounov exponents as directions (Sano and Sawaka, 1985; Eckmann et al, 1986;\nGeist et al, 1990). The techniques of regularization by which these model processes\napproximate the unknown flow include those with least squares, linear fit\nassumptions (Eckmann et al, 1986; Sato et al, 1987; Buzug et al, 1990), more\ndetailed fits involving polynomial expressions in higher powers (Briggs, 1990; Brown\net al, 1991; Bryant et al, 1991) and techniques such as “singular value\ndecomposition” which decomposes the flow into orthogonal components before\ncomputing the logarithmic rate of divergence of nearby points on each of them\n(Stoop and Parisi, 1991). A clever check on the Lyapounov number obtained is to\nstudy the flow backwards so that, for example, some rate of separation of points in\nthe forward direction would approximate the rate of convergence in the time\nreversed data (Parlitz, 1992).\nAmong the sources of spurious Lyapounov exponents are sample lengths\nthat are too short and/or too measurement-noisy to compute a statistically stable\naverage, embedding dimensions that are too high or low and attractors (many of\nphysiological relevance) that have geometric features such as sharp corners or tight\nfolds as in the Rössler (where points gather) or delicate boundary points such as\nthose on the body on the Lorenz butterfly (see above) where very small distances\ndetermine whether the orbit makes big jumps to the right or left wing leading to\nuncharacteristically large separations. This “nonuniformity” in the rates of expansion\nand contraction in the dynamics over the attractor, a source of error in computations\nof statistical indices of the average behavior, becomes a useful tool in\ncharacterizing individual differences in sets of neurobiological data ranging from\n220\nbrain enzyme kinetics (Mandell, 1984) and single neuron firing patterns (Selz and\nMandell, 1991) to human psychomotor and cognitive behavior (Selz, 1992; Selz and\nMandell, 1993).\nThe Leading λ( + ) of Some Biologically Relevant Time Series\nAn early application of a simplified form of leading Lyapounov exponent to\nbrain data involved the computation of the one dimensional averaged slope of in\nvitro studies of psychopharmacological drug and peptide effects on time series of\ncatecholamine and indoleamine biosynthetic enzyme activities studied at\nphysiological, far-from-equilibrium reactant concentrations (Russo and Mandell,\n1984b; Knapp and Mandell, 1984). A contemporaneous study also suggested the\ninfluence of differences in initial conditions for pharmacokinetic equilibrium times in\ndrug binding kinetics by proteins (Bayne and Hwang, 1985).\nThe most extensive applications to the clincial neurosciences of the\nLyapounov measure of the exponential divergence of orbital points has involved\nreconstructed brain wave attractors from the intracranial or scalp recordings of the\nEEG (Duke and Pritchard, 1991; Dvorak and Holden, 1991; Jansen and Brandt,\n1993). Space prevents us from surveying more than a small representative set of\nthe studies (Jansen, 1996). It should be noted, however, that this is an area in\nwhich “state of the art” research has grown quite complicated and somewhat\ncontroversial with respect to technical issues. The choices of the digitizing\nfrequency of the smooth record, the dimension of the embedding space and time\ndelays continue to be debated in the context of numerical computations of λ and\ndimension measures (Mayer-Kress, 1986; Ott et al, 1994).\nControls for the implicitly required statistical discrimination between\n“randomness” and “deterministic chaos” consist of sequence and (Fourier) phase\nrandomization generating “surrogate data” which conserve the probability\ndistributions and destroy the correlation properties and attractor geometries (Sauer\net al, 1991; Ott et al, 1994). Since neither bring with them any connections with\n221\nknown or explorable brain mechanisms, one might argue that at this early stage of\nthe work it would be more desirable to simply report the quantitative findings,\nleaving unanswerable questions about ultimate causality for later discussion (see\nbelow).\nThe first EEG λ( + ) was reported in a patient with epilepsy (Babloyantz and\nDestexhe, 1986) which was confirmed by others (Iasemedia et al, 1988; Frank et\nall, 1990). An important study of simultaneous time series from 16 subdural\nelectrodes placed in the right temporal cortex of a patient with a right medial\ntemporal lobe epileptogenic focus demonstrated that a decrease in a single lead’s\nλ( + ) reliably anteceded and localized the first signs of the incipient seizure. The\nrest of the leads followed with similarly decreased positivity in their leading\nLyapounov exponents associated with spatially coherent patterns of behavior. In\naddition, the averaged value of the leading Lyapounov exponents in the 16 leads\nincreased post-ictally over the averaged values of λ( + ) in the pre-ictal state\n(Iasemidis et al, 1988,1990). These findings, including seizure anticipation for 25\nminutes, were confirmed using intracranial recordings in 16 patients with temporal\nlobe epilepsy (Elger and Lehnertz, 1998). The para-ictal decrease and post-ictal\nincrease in λ( + ) found in patients with focal temporal lobe seizures was confirmed\nmore generally in left and right pre-frontal-to-mastoid EEG recordings made before,\nduring and after electroconvulsive shock treatment of psychiatric patients (Krystal\nand Weiner, 1991). Pre-ictal changes were also found six minutes before seizure\nonset from scalp EEG recordings in 17/19 patients with chronic focal epilepsy\n(Martinerie et al, 1998). The most exciting potential application of this approach is\nits use, in real time, for the prediction and prophylactic treatment of incipient\nseizures, minutes to hours before the event, in place of or augmenting long term\ndrug management (Iasemidis and Sackellares, 1996).\nThere is a growing literature about leading Lyapounov exponent(s) in the\nreconstructed attractor of the EEG associated with a variety of normal and\npathological human behavioral states. For examples, two and sometimes three\n222\nλ( + ) were reported in awake relaxed subjects and were lost in deep sleep (Stage\nIV) and coma (advanced Jakob-Creutzfeld disease), suggesting that level of\nconsciousness correlated positively with amount of orbital divergence (Gallez and\nBablioyantz, 1991). A “pathologically low” leading λ( + ) was also found to be\ncharacteristic of the EEG of patients with Alzheimer’s syndromes (Jeong et al,\n1998). Technically defined sleep stages (I, II, III, IV, REM) were found to correlate\nwell with the values of the leading λ( + ) of the EEG in normal subjects (Fell et al,\n1993; 1996; Pradhan and Sadasivan, 1996). EEG recordings during problem\nsolving sometimes, but not always, demonstrated a relationship between values of\nλ( + ) and the kind or amount of load of the task (Micheloyannis et al, 1998;\nPopivanovov et al, 1998; Meyer-Lindenberg et al, 1998). Both emotionally positive\nand negative videos increased the value of the leading λ( + )(Aftanos et al, 1997) as\ndid computer generated music with sounds that exploited a “pleasing” hierarchical,\n1/f but not an “unpleasant” 1/f 2 frequency spectrum (see previous section about\npower law scaling) (Jeong et al, 1998). The EEG theta rhythm of “day dreaming”\nmanifested a lower λ( + ) than the “relaxed alert awake” alpha rhythm (Roschke et al,\n1997). Relationships between the Lyapounov spectra demonstrated both regional\nindependence and task-related dependence in the magnetoencephalography record\nin man (Kowalik and Elbert, 1995).\nThese and other studies suggest that divergence rate of orbits on a\ngeometrically reconstructed attractor is a subtle measure, which can be quantified\nas a continuous variable and which has been found to be useful in a variety of\nneuroscience-related, experimental contexts. The range includes the\ncharacterization of the discharge pattern of a single somatic or renal sympathetic\nnerve fiber (Gong et al, 1998;Zhang and Johns, 1998); quantifying the results of\nperturbing autonomic nervous system activity, for examples, exercise, atropine and\npropranolol decrease λ( + ) in the cardiac interbeat interval attractor (Hagerman et\nal, 1996) and interference with the function of the baroreflex or clonidine alters the\nλ( + ) in the blood pressure attractor in man and animals (Wagner et al, 1996;\n223\nMestivier et al, 1998); and predicting defects in visual learning functions from\ndecreases in the λ( + ) of the cardiac interbeat interval attractor in patients with\nmultiple sclerosis (Ganz and Faustman, 1996).\nWe recall that on theoretical grounds (Guckenheimer and Holmes, 1983), a\ndecrease in the positivity of λ( + ) → λ( 0)\nin a delay coordinate, geometric\nreconstruction of a time series of observables may auger an incipient global\nbifurcation in the system’s dynamics. As reviewed above, this has turned out to be\nthe case in several studies of the EEG and electrocorticogram in epileptic patients.\nFuther research will be required to see if this idea has substance more generally for\npredicting “catastrophic” changes in other brain-related systems.\nPower Law Scaling of Orbital Geometries in Time Series Reconstructions\nBenoit Mandelbrot’s book in its first incarnation was derived from his lectures\nat College de France in 1973 and 1974 and was called Les Objets Fractals: Forme,\nHasard et Dimension (Mandelbrot, 1975). This essay was translated into English as\nFractals, Form Chance and Dimension (Mandelbrot, 1977). Later expanded and\nreworked editions displayed another title, The Fractal Geometry of Nature\n(Mandelbrot, 1982) but the deep conceptual, sometimes poetic fusion and confusion\ngenerated by the apparent identity among the objects of his first title remains.\n“Fractal,” along with “chaos” and “strange attractor” are among the most widely\nfamiliar new words in modern dynamical systems research. Fractal is the most\ndifficult to rigorously define and is commonly misunderstood due to the evocative\nyet dream-like cognitive condensations provoked by the first title and its reflections\nin Mandelbrot’s prose. A common conceptual confusion is exemplified by the\nassumed relation between “fractal time event distributions” of the cardiac interbeat\ninterval and the “fractal like” anatomy of the purkinje network of the cardiac\nconduction system. Data from both contexts are often shown juxtaposed in the\nsame illustration as though their relationships were obvious (Goldberger et al, 1990;\nGoldberger, 1996; Liebovitch and Todorov, 1996). “Fractal times” and “fractal\n224\ngeometries” are not related to each other essentially, either in the mathematical or\nphysiological domain, but are often made vaguely equivalent on the basis of their\nlexical similarity.\nAn experimentally meaningful relationship between fractal statistics (hazard),\ndynamical fractals (dimension) and fractal geometries (form), has to be proven on a\ncase by case basis and not assumed from their common designation. Among the\ninformal attempts to do this have been those that involve the branching pattern of\nnerves and the associated reductions in their diameter-dependent characteristic\nconduction velocities yielding a multiplicity of “arrival times.” There is, however, a\nmore central idea common to these concatenated meanings of fractal: the\nstatistical, dynamical and geometric expressions of “scaling,” a word which is not\nmentioned in Mandelbrot’s book titles. The cluster of theories, theorems and\nmethods associated with the idea of scaling (and renormalization) have led to Nobel\nPrizes for Flory (1971), Wilson (1975) and de Gennes (1979) and the (equivalent\nmathematical) Field’s Medal for McMullen (1994). There is speculation that the last\ntwo awards were supported by the inspiration and interest given their research by\nMandelbrot’s intuitions and books.\nScaling laws take the place of (unknown causal) physical laws by indicating\nthe proportion by which observables of a system can be changed in relationship to\neach other such that some statement about them, “this varies with that,” still holds.\nIn a cross species comparison, as the average weight of a mammalian body, called\nlb, increases, the skeletal weight, called w, increases at an exponentially greater\nrate: w goes like lb 1.08 where lb 1.0 would indicate that they grew across species at\nthe same rate. Plotting log (lb) on the x axis and log (w) on the y axis in a log-log\nplot results in a straignt line with a slope that indicates the power law scaling\nrelationship between body weight and skeletal weight across mammals. The slope\nof the scaling exponent of 1.08 is a little over 45 ° = 1. In contrast, the metabolic rate,\nr, goes like (lb) 0.75 , r ≈ (lb) 0.75 . Larger animals (relative to their weight) have lower\nbasal metabolic rates (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1984). We don’t completely know the chain\nof intervening mechanisms that relate these variables to each other but we do know\n225\ninvariant scaling laws that describe their relationships within some limits on the\nrange of values.\nIn describing the functional size, radius of gyration, R g , of a polymer such as\na polypeptide, composed of N monomers, assume each of the amino acids to be\nthe same and that they are in a “good” hydrophobic solvent that didn’t stick the\npolymer together in a fold. Flory (1971) found a scaling law for certain broad classes\nof polymers and solvents, R g ≈ αN ν , where the exponent, ν = 3/5, was universal, N\nindicated the number of monomers in the chain and the value of “pre-factor” α\ndepended upon the particular monomer and solvent chosen. Log R g plotted against\nlog N has a “power law” slope of 0.60. For an equally static but less physical\nexample, there is the well known Zipf law of “vocabulary balance”(Zipf, 1949). First\nreported for the 260,450 words of James Joyce’s Ulysses, the slope of the log of the\nrank of the words found (ordered from most to least along x) plotted against the log\nof their frequency (along y) results in a power law that is (generally) true for other\ncollections of words and in other languages.\nAn accessible example of a dynamical scaling law arises in a two\ndimensional lattice model of a forest which is to be set on fire with probability p\nindependent random single tree ignitions. At some critical p, p c , the fire sweeps\nthrough the entire forest (“percolates”) and the correlation length of the connected\nclusters grows as |p-p c | -γ with a universal scaling exponent, γ = 4/3, for all Monte\nCarlo, two dimensional percolation problems (Stauffer, 1985; Grimmett, 1989).\nMandelbrot’s scheme for the power laws that compose his fractal geometry\nof dynamical objects is a measure made on the pattern of occupancy in the\nembedding space by the reconstructed orbits of an attractor. It is, generally,\nmass ≈ length D 0\nin which D (the subscript that of the “capacity dimension”) is not the\n0\nwhole number of Euclidian dimensions, d, of the space in which the orbits are\nembedded. After Hausdorff’s “convergence of external and internal measures”\n(Hurewicz and Wallman, 1948), the (capacity) fractal dimension D is also defined\nas being larger than its topological dimension and smaller than its Euclidian\nembedding dimension. Graphing a time series on a plane one can think of its\n0\n226\ntopological dimension as that of a line equal to one. If each time step had the\nlargest up or down amplitude as possible, its fractal dimension would approach (but\nnot reach) that of the embedding plane, Euclidean d = 2.\nThe D 0 of the one dimensional Richardson technique (Mandelbrot, 1967) can\nbe computed by covering the one dimensional surface of a time series with a\nnumber, #, of line segments of several orders of magnitude range of lengths, l\n.Graphing log(l) along the x-axis and log #(l) along the y-axis yields a negative linear\nslope, -s. As defined, 1- s = D 0 noting that (-(-s)→+s) such that 1 < D 0 = 1+s < 2.\nStrain differences and peptide and psychotropic drug-induced changes in D 0\ncomputed in this way were found in time series of fluctuations in rat brainstem\ntyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylase activities under far-from-equilibrium coreactant\nconcentrations (Mandell and Russo, 1981; Knapp et al, 1981; Knapp and\nMandell, 1983; 1984). Systematic influences of stimulant drug dose on D 0 were\nfound as well in these systems (Mandell et al, 1982). This simple measure, made\ndirectly on the “roughness” of the graph of a one dimensional time series rather than\non its orbital reconstruction, has been used to discriminate the pattern of\nfluctuations in daily mood scales in normal subjects and mood disordered patients\n(Woyshville et al, 1999). These findings confirmed dimensional scaling exponents\non higher dimensional embeddings of similar time series in mood disordered\npatients (Gottschalk et al, 1995; Pezard et al, 1996). Due to the ease and rapidity of\nits computation, techniques involving D 0 on one dimensional time series are\ncurrently in development as possible real time epilepsy predictors when analyzing\nthe output of a large number of EEG leads simultaneously.\nIf M(ε) is the minimum number of d-dimensional cubes of side ε required to\ncover the d-dimensionally embedded attractor, plotting a logarithmic range of rulers\nof length ε (as ε→0) along the x axis and a logarithmic range of number of cubes,\nM(ε), each of corresponding ε-edge size, along the y axis, results in a negative\n(more smaller M(ε) ‘s and fewer bigger M(ε) ‘s) power law slope D 0 . Here the\nnumbered covering cubes, M(ε), are those in which the probability of containing at\nleast one point (its “probability density measure,” often called µ) is not zero. We\n227\nnote that changing the ratios of the numbers of cubes that are dense in point\nprobability to those that are sparse would not influence the value of D 0 . This helps\ndifferentiate D 0 from other dimensions and, as noted above, D 0 as a maximal\nestimate of the fractal dimension, is called the capacity dimension and by\nconvention the scaling law is written\nM\n( ε)\nD\n≈ ε\n− 0\n. More specifically, D0 is calculated\nby repeatedly dividing the d-dimensionally embedded phase space into equal d-\ndimensional hypercubes and plotting the log of the fraction of the hypercubes\ncontaining data points versus the log of the (normalized) linear dimension (“length\nscale”) of the hypercubes. The slope fitted to the most linear part of the slope\n(usually the middle 50%) indicates the capacity dimension. D 0 is computed for\nincreasing embedding (and cube) dimension, d, until it achieves an asymptotic\nplateau, it “saturates”. This is but one of a range of geometric scaling exponents,\n“dimensions,” that are currently being computed (Farmer et al, 1983; Grassberger\nand Procaccia, 1983; Meyer-Kress, 1986; Theiler, J. (1990); Gershenfeld, 1992; Ott\net al,, 1994).\nAlthough still subject to debate, convention has it that the sample length\nrequired to determine this most primitive of dimension computations goes like\nD\n10 0\n(e.g. a dimension of 2.45 requires a sample length of at least 282 points).\nAssuming robust findings using D0 as indicated by non-parametric tests of\nsignificance in test-retest, before and after, drug treatment designs, this arbitrary\ncriteria sounds more like ritual than meaningful help for the clinical neuroscientist\nwith (say) 100 spinal fluid hormone and metabolite samples painfully and\nlaboriously collected from a patient’s indwelling catheter over 48 hours. In the\ncontext of real data (and not numerical studies of differential equations), we are\ndealing with empirical findings that must find their meaning (or lack of) in the context\nof questions about issues in the neurosciences, not in abstract questions such as\nthose about the number of dimensions that an unknown differential equation would\nrequire to represent the data (Broomhead and King, 1986). In a similar arbitrary\nspirit, a system manifesting a D 0 > 5 is considered not discriminable from a random\nprocess; e.g. the difference between D 0 = 5 versus D 0 = 7 (though perhaps\nstatistically significant) is thought to be without meaning. Since in neurobiological\n228\nresearch, “random” (if it doesn’t mean measurement error) indicates unknown\ndegrees of freedom, this D 0 > 5 rule is also without relevance for brain research.\nD 1 is called the “information dimension” and is computed by counting the\nnumber of ε-cubes, M(ε), it takes to cover the points constituting some fixed fraction\nof all of the points of the set of orbital points on the attractor and can be regarded as\nthe “core dimension” (without the outliers) of the set. The counterintuitive finding is\nthat D 1 is nearly constant across a range of fixed fractions that are less than the\nwhole measure (Farmer et al, 1983). The invariance of D 1 can even be taken to the\nextreme by computing the D\nM\nlim ln ( ε )\nε ln( ε)\n1\n=\n→o\naround (typical, not all) single points. In\nthis context, D 1 is called the “pointwise dimension” or “singularity exponent” and, as\nmight be anticipated, its value is usually less than that of D 0 .\nThe scaling exponent that is both sensitive to point densities and easiest to\ncompute from real data is the “correlation dimension,” D 2. Here, analogous to the\nrelationship between the amplitudes of the variance and the correlation function in\nconventional statistics, the measure squared is of interest for the computation of D 2 ,\ne.g.\nM ( ε )\n2\nI( 2, ε ) = ∑[ µ ( Ci\n)] (see below for this use of measure µ on sum Σ of cubes Ci).\ni=\n1\nThe selection of D 2 as the fractal measure dominates the studies that invoke scaling\nexponents to quantify the distributions of points on the attractor as reconstructed\nfrom time series in the neurosciences (Grassberger and Procaccia, 1983; Mayer-\nKress, 1986; Ott et al, 1994). Several sets of programs are available for its\ncomputation (for example, Sprott and Rowlands, 1991). Generally, a correlation\nsum (“integral”, R(ε) ) is computed from a starting point by counting all subsequent\npoint pairs with distances between them less than ε as ε→0 and plotting\nD\n2\nlim ln( R( ε)\n= . D 2 is computed for increasing embedding (and therefore\nε → 0 ln( ε)\nhypercube) dimension, d, until D 2 achieves an asymptotic plateau, it “saturates”\n(Ding et al, 1993).\nIt is generally the case that D 0 ≥ D 1 ≥ D 2 (Farmer et al, 1983).\n229\nIn his statistical explorations of experimental results in hydrodynamic\nturbulence, Mandelbrot (1974) called attention to the need for a multiplicity of\ncharacteristic scaling exponents, a range of values for each exponent and their\nsensitivity to orbital point density distributions (the latter called the Sinai-Ruelle-\nBowen or natural measure (Eckmann and Ruelle, 1985)). These needs grew out of\nthe intrinsic heterogeneity in the time dynamics and the nonuniform point\ndistributions in phase space of orbitally divergent, real physical systems. Even with\nrelatively uniform orbital point distributions, it is intuitively obvious that as ε → 0, the\nsmaller ε- cubes are over-represented and larger ε- cubes are under-represented in\nthe M(ε) computation (Farmer et al, 1983). For a concrete example, the fraction of\nthe total number of cubes containing say 75% of the points would obviously\ndecrease as the ε-lengths studied gets smaller. Normalizing the D i measures with\nrespect to point densities would correct for this systematic distortion. In addition, the\nnon-systematic influence of real system heterogeneity and non-uniformity in both\ntime and reconstruction space distributions makes the need for relating the D i\nmeasures to the natural measure even more pressing.\nThe derivation of many separate scaling exponents, as well as global\ngeneralized exponents and the incorporation of point densities in their computation,\nhas been approached by a kind of method of moments (Renyi, 1970; Grassberger,\n1983; Hentschel and Procaccia, 1983; Halsey et al, 1986; Mayer-Kress, 1986; Ott et\nal, 1994). We outline the general arguments here so that the reader will be\ngenerally familiar with the ideas and terms, not to serve as a definitive summary. It\nis a complicated area and the reader will find the required detailed descriptions in\nthe references. .\nWe recall that with respect to a statistical distribution, the first moment is the\nmean; the second moment, σ 2 , the variance; the third moment, σ 3 , the distribution’s\nasymmetry, the skew; and the fourth moment, σ”, its relative peakedness with\nrespect to the probability mass in the tail, called the kurtosis. In these moment\ncomputations of an observable\nq\nx i\n’s deviation from the mean, |x − x| , the value for\nq accentuate particular regions of the density distribution. Similarly, the q’s of the\ni\n230\n“generalized dimensions,” D q , emphasize different aspects of the relative point\ndensity that are assumed to be uniform in the computation of D 0 . We recall from\nabove that the power law slope constituting D\nln M( ε)\nlim\nε ln( ε)\n0 = →o\n. If we emphasize the\ncomponent of the probability (measure, µ) or, equivalently, time spent by the orbit in\ncube i, µ( C i\n) instead of simply the number of cubes occupied by any points, M(ε),\nalong with the different length scales of the cube as ε→0 we have a generalized\ndimension. A common expression for the generalized dimension includes the\nfractional pre-factor in q written so as to make things come out right:\nM ( ε )\nIq\nD = 1 lim ln ( , ε)\nq\n, where Iq ( , ε ) = ∑[ µ ( C i\n)]\nq −1ε\n→ 0 ln( ε)\ni=\n1\nthe dominance of the higher probability cubes,\nq\n. The higher the q, the greater\nµ( C i\n). To see how this q-induced\nseparation in emphasis might work, if the ratio for q = 2 between the probability\ncontaining cubes 0.25 and 0.05 is 25, their ratio for q = 3 is 125. For q = 0, the\nscaling exponent is the capacity dimension. This result of the actions of a changing\nq has been analogized to the way changing temperature in a thermodynamic\nsystem evokes different aspects of its behavior.\nThe “multifractal formalism” generally begins by determining the statistical\ndensities over a range of scale lengths by one means or another including wavelet\ntransformations across wavelength scale (Arneodo et al, 1988). These densities by\nscale are then systematically raised to a range of q exponents. Since q, and\ntherefore D q , can vary continuously, functions are created that shows how D q varies\nwith q. These are then further transformed, resulting in a single maximum parabolic\ncurve whose shape and size is sensitive to the conditions of the experiment (Halsey\net al, 1986). Generalized dimensions decrease as q increases. A unique\nneuropsychopharmacological application of the multifractal technique to a study of\nthe behavioral influence of increasing amounts of cocaine on the time-dependent\npatterns of spatial exploration, temporal-spatial fluctuations, in rats, demonstrated a\nglobal splitting in the parabolic distribution suggestive of a cocaine-induced global\nphase transition, not unlike the well-known, dose-dependent, amphetamine-induced\n231\nshift from hyperactivity to motor stereotypy (Paulus et al, 1991). Studies that\nfollowed demonstrated that “q-moment” distributions of heterogeneous scaling\nexponents and their relative statistical weightings were useful in making subtle\ndiscriminations between effects of psychopharmacological agents and behavioral\n(isolation) influences on animal behavior as well as patterns of simple psychomotor\nbehavior in normal subjects and schizophrenic patients (Paulus et al, 1994; 1996;\n1998; Krebs-Thomson et al, 1998a; 1998b).\nFractal Scaling Measures on Reconstructed Time Series from\nBiological Dynamics\nPublications involving the applications of various D measures, particularly D 2 ,\nto brain-relevant times series number in the hundreds and are growing\nexponentially. The following constitutes a brief review of a representative set of\nempirical findings. In doing so, for the reasons discussed below, we ignore what\nsome might consider the rather abstract and philosophical issue of “determinism”\nversus “randomness” or “error” (Sugihara and May, 1990; Casdagli, 1991; Wayland\net al, 1993; Kaplan and Glass, 1992; Kaplan, 1994) since this question is relatively\nunproductive with respect to generating new neurobiological insights, novel\nexperiments or new quantitative approaches to brain dynamics. In addition, as\nnoted in the final section, this discrimination may not even have definitive theoretical\nmeaning in that the conduct of much of the rigorous mathematics about\n“deterministic dynamical systems” involve Markoff partitions and matrices which are\nalso the generic operators of formal probability theory (Sullivan, 1979; Kolmogorov,\n1950). For example, N-dimensional non-linear Markoff processes can be shown to\ncapture the dynamics of multidimensional neurobiological processes such as the\nEEG (Silipo et al, 1998).\nWe have also ignored the related issue of the presence or absence of “low\ndimensional structure” (Theiler and Rapp, 1996; Rapp, 1995) which, from the\nauthors’ point of view, resulted from an unfortunately concrete interpretation of the\nword “dimensions.” With respect to experimental brain data, dimensions are defined\n232\nmost relevantly by their computational procedures and what are computed are\nempirical scaling exponents describing real observables as limited by the precision\nof the observations, their resolution and series lengths (Smith, 1988; Eckmann and\nRuelle, 1992). The “correlation integral,” the probability that two vectors chosen at\nrandom from the phase space reconstruction lie within “r” distance of each other,\nnot unrelated to the phase randomization controlled, D 2 measure, yields statements\nabout amount of “nonlinearity” (not accountable by the linear regressively\ncapturable component of the power spectrum), which are also difficult to translate\ninto experimentally or theoretically useful concepts (Casdagli et al, 1997). These\nefforts contrast with a more direct attempt to establish a spiking neuron system’s\ndynamical “dimension” using trial and error prediction in which “dimension” was\ndefined as the number of potentially physiologically relevant variables required to\nmake the predictive equations fit (Segundo et al, 1998).\nComputations of scaling exponent descriptors of orbital point distributions on\nreconstructed attractors of the brain sciences have proven to be most useful as\natheoretical, empirical techniques discriminating experimental, clinical and/or\ntreatment conditions with various approaches to statistical significance. In this\nregard, one can say that D 2 is often found to be superior to central tendency\noriented statistics in making these discriminations. Dimension and correlation\nintegral descriptors appear least useful when dealing with global issues such as\nchaos, randomness, linearity and the “underlying dimensions” of (unknown)\ndifferential equations. We discuss below the possibility that the failure to find chaos\nin the more recent EEG studies (Theiler and Rapp, 1996; Prichard et al, 1996) may\nbe because the EEG attractor is better characterized as a “strange nonchaotic\natttractor” with orbital patterns manifesting fractional scaling exponents but no λ( + )\n(Grebogi et al, 1984; Mandell and Selz, 1993).\nThe relatively subtle influence of high altitude (Mt. Everest) oxygen\nconcentrations was not seen in the central moments of the cardiac interbeat\nintervals, but the D 2 of the attactor was reduced significantly (Yamamoto et al,\n1993). The latencies and amplitudes of the visual evoked potential failed to\n233\ndiscriminate normal subjects from those with early glaucoma, but the reconstructed\nattractor of the steady state visual cortical response to full field flicker demonstrated\na statistically significant decrease in D 2 (Schmeisser et al, 1993). Marginal\nqualitative differences in optokinetic nystagmus were quantitatively significant when\nstudied as the D 2 of the attractor’s points in patients with vertigo compared with\ncontrols (Aasen et al, 1997). Reconstructions of maximum velocity waves from\nDoppler studies of middle cerebral artery hemodynamics (using phase random\n“controls”) demonstrated an increase in D 2 (and a decrease in λ( + ) correlated with\nage in an adult population (Keuner et al, 1996; Vliegen et al, 1996). D 2 served as a\nsensitive descriptor of functional changes in the EMG from the surface of the biceps\nmuscle, increasing with muscle load and rate of flexion and extension and\ndecreasing with muscle fatigue (Rapp et al, 1993; Nieminen and Takala, 1996;\nGupta et al, 1997), suggesting its use in suspected early myotonic dystrophies and\nmyasthenias. Reconstructed time series of stomatognathic motions in high school\nstudents with temporomandipular joint syndromes compared with those with\nmalocclusion revealed a specific decrease in D 0 in the plane of horizontal motion in\nthe former (Morinushi et al, 1998). Time series of plasma growth hormone levels in\nacromegalic patients with functioning pituitary adenomas manifested a statistically\nsignificant increase in D 0 when compared with age-matched controls (Mandell and\nSelz, 1997) which corresponded nicely to the reduction in “approximate entropy”\n(Pincus, 1991a) computed on this same data set (Hartman et al, 1994). On the\nother hand, comparative in vitro studies of growth hormone release patterns in\nnormal rat pituitary cells and their neoplastically transformed relatives, the GH3\nstrain, demonstrate a decrease in D 0 in the latter (Guillemin et al, 1983; Mandell,\n1986).\nThe number of examples of the use of D 2 on orbital point geometries in\nexplorations of physiological and pharmacological regulation are increasing. The D 2\nof respiratory rhythms is higher with intact vagal afferents than without (Sammon\nand Bruce, 1991). Histamine induced an increase in D 2 in the attractor point\ndistribution of rabbit ear artery vasomotion, attributed to calcium-activated\nmembrane potassium channels in that TEA prevented and reversed the change\n234\n(Edwards and Griffith, 1997). The role of central and autonomic innervation in\ncardiac interval dynamics has been explored using D 2 in various ways. For\nexamples, the transplanted heart rhythm in man has a lower D 2 than that of the\nnormal heart (Guzzetti et al, 1996) and general anesthesia and cholinergic (but not\nβ-adrenergic) blockade decreased multisystem D 2 in a series of multiparameter\n(respiration, mean blood pressure and heart rate) studies in piglets (Zwiener et al,\n1996; Hoyer et al, 1998).\nThe activities of single and aggregates of neurons are being described and\ndifferentiated by the D 2 of their interevent interval attractors. Early and important\nstudies related to both neuronal and field electrical activity indicated their promise\n(Rapp et al, 1985; Zimmerman and Rapp, 1991). The olefactory bulb demonstrated\nspatially uniform scaling dimensions that changed with event-related perturbation\n(Skinner et al, 1990). An iron-induced spiking focus in the rat hippocampus in vivo\nmanifested the same decrease in D 2 as it did in the kindled in vitro hippocampal\nslice (Koch et al, 1992). D 2 also differentiated among characteristic single unit time\nseries in norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin neurons (Selz and Mandell,\n1991) and among A8, A9 and A10 dopamine neurons (Selz and Mandell, 1992).\nAttractors reconstructed from single unit interspike intervals in the substantia nigra\npars compacta and the auditory thalamus manifested discriminatable values for D 2\nin neurons recorded by the same electrode (Celletti and Villa, 1996) and changes in\nstate manifested in patterns of subthreshold oscillations in single neurons in the\ninferioir olivary nucleus could be characterized using this index (Makarenko and\nLlinas, 1998).\nD 2 reliably discriminated between states of arousal and between the\nmultiparameter (eye movements, neck muscle tone, EEG stage) defined EEG\nstages of sleep (Bablyoyantz, 1986; Rapp et al, 1989; Ehlers et al, 1991) with non-\nREM having a lower D 2 than REM. D 2 of the EEG record was selectively reduced in\nStage II and REM in schizophrenic patients compared with controls (Roschke and\nAldenhoff, 1993), this difference was made more prominent by treatment with the\naminodiazopoxide, lorazepam (Roschke and Aldenhoff, 1992). In the waking state,\n235\nhigher EEG D 2 values were frontal in schizophrenic patients and more central in\ncontrols (Elbert et al, 1992). The D 2 computed on the EEG during Stage IV (“delta”)\nsleep was sensitive to acute sleep deprivation and recovery, but demonstrated\ncompensation (Cerf et al, 1996). Non-alcholic children of alcoholic parents\nmanifested lower values for D 1 in their EEG attractors than the children of a normal\ncontrol group (Ehlers et al, 1995). Higher I.Q. correlated with EEG D 2 in most leads\nin the resting state but not during a visual imagery task (Lutzenberger et al, 1992).\nThese differences also correlated with individual differences in task performance in\na perceptual pattern predictive task (Gregson et al, 1990) and with a working\nmemory task load with regional differences most marked in the right fronto-temporal\ncortex (Sammer, 1996).\nPeripheral nerve stimulation in the earlobe and trapezius muscle induced\nincrements in D 2 in the EEG of specific brain regions (Heffernan, 1996). Memory for\nbut not induced pain increased EEG D 2 in chronic pain patients but not in normal\ncontrols (Lutzenberger et al, 1997). Using contingent reinforcement of brain wave\nmodes by hypothalamic, but not cerebral hemispheric, stimulation reduced D 2 in the\nEEG (Mogilevskii et al, 1998) resembling the changes accompanying defensive\nreflex conditioning in the rabbit between the early and late stages of the process\n(Efremova and Kulikov, 1997). Difficult to diagnose “periodic lateralized epileptiform\ndischarge” syndromes have apparently yielded to D 2 computations (Stam et al,\n1998). In equally problematic “atypical seizure” syndromes in children, D 2 computed\non the autocovariance functions of 200 Hz digitized EEG records from multiple\nchannels demonstrated characteristic changes (Yaylali et al, 1996).\nUnlike computing a reliable leading λ( + ) on a point set of a time series\nreconstruction denoting the “sensitivity to initial conditions” requirement for the\ndiagnosis of chaos (and a potential for change such that a decrease in the positivity\nof λ( + ) → λ( 0)\nmay auger a nearby bifurcation), the presence of a fractional scaling\nexponent,\nD i\n, does not in and of itself implicate a chaotic dynamical state. A nice\nexample of a nonchaotic dynamic with\nλ = 0 that has a fractional scaling exponent,\nD = 0.538, is the “Feigenbaum” point where the above noted “infinite” series of\n236\nperiod doubling bifurcations accumulate (Grassberger, 1981). This is a dust-like\nregion, which when endlessly dilated looks like the same dust. Some\nmathematicians call these objects “Lebesgue points” because even though at low\nmagnifications when they look rather solid, they are not. Composed of points, they\nhave topological measure zero (a line has measure one) and non-integer fractal\ndimension. These λ = 0 , D ≠ Integer, period doubling accumulation points can be\nfound in a wide variety of attractors, though in each case the parameter space in\nwhich they are located is so small (in point set topology also called “Lebesgue\nmeasure zero”) that they are very difficult to locate and therefore have little chance\nof being physiologically significant.\nThis constrasts with a relatively new category of dynamical systems which\npromises to be important in studies of the nervous system. These are ones that are\ndriven by two or more independent frequencies (called quasiperiodic driving). We\nfound them to be relevant to brain stem, thalamocortical neurophysiology of\nperceptual processes and states of consciousness. They have the properties,\nλ = 0 , D 0 and D 1 ≠ integer and a characteristic scaling “spectral distribution\nfunction” (see below). They have been named “strange nonchaotic attractors”\n(Grebogi et al, 1984; Romeiras et al, 1987; Ding et al, 1989). In addition, the\nstrange nonchaotic behavior of these quasiperiodically-driven, nonlinear oscillators\nhas positive (>0) measure in parameter space and thus is of potential physiological\nsignificance. A good demonstration of a multiple frequency driven strange\nnonchaotic attractor can be found and manipulated in the software package of\nNusse and Yorke (1991).\nThe neurobiological substrate for this system is the brain stem neuronal\nmodulatory driving of on- going thalamocortcal oscillatory brain waves (once called\n“recruitment waves” in the 7-14 Hz, θ to α, day dreaming to quiet alert range) and\nas perturbed by multifrequency driving in what was once called “reticular formation\narousal” are realized as dominant EEG modes and associated states of perceptual\nacuity and consciousness (Moruzzi and Magoun 1949; Moruzzi, 1960; Klemm,\n1990; Steriade and McCarley, 1990; Contreras et al, 1997). In addition to intrinsic\n237\nmultiply periodic and aperiodic oscillations of thalamic and cortical cells and their\nrecursive, feedback coupling, the brain stem manifests more than two orders of\nmagnitude of “independent” neuronal driving frequencies ranging from serotonin\ndischarges at 1 Hz, cortically direct dopamine and norepinephrine neurons in the\n10-50Hz range and mesencephalic reticular neurons discharging as fast as 100 to\n200 Hz. The “thalamocortical brain wave oscillator” as their target has been a fixture\nin global state neurophysiology since the 1940’s and 1950’s and is of great current\ninterest (Fessard et al, 1961; Bazhenov et al, 1998). We have explored the\nrelationships between strange nonchaotic dynamics and brain-stem neuronal and\nthalamocortical physiology from the standpoint of neuronal coding and the\nproperties of the EEG attractor. (Mandell et al, 1991; Mandell and Kelso, 1991;\nMandell and Selz, 1992; 1993;1994;1997a). We found that the EEG attractor could\nbe characterized by the diagnostic triad identifying strange nonchaotic attractors:\nλ = 0 , D 0 and D 1 ≠ Integer, and a signatory power spectral distribution in which the\nnumber of peaks, N, with amplitudes greater than ϖ, N(ϖ ), went as ϖ -α , 1 < α < 2\n(Romeiras et al, 1987; Mandell et al, 1991). In addition to being consistent with\nknown multifrequency, brain stem driving of thalamocortical oscillations, the EEG as\na strange, nonchaotic attractor is intuitively appealing in that it has the necessary\nmechanisms for the power law scaling of a wide range of characteristic times (D 0\nand D 1 ≠ Integer) from picosecond fluctuations of neural membrane proteins to the\ndecades of bipolar phenomena and since λ = 0 , the orbital points don’t tend to\n“mix”(get out of order) on the attractor, thus protecting the fidelity of sequence\ndependent brain information transport (Berns and Sejnowski, 1998).\nEntropies, Unstable Periodic Orbits and Shadowing; Short Time Series\nCan Discriminate Experimental Conditions in Studies of Biological Dynamics\nWe avoid the temptation to deal with the deep analogy between\nthermodynamic entropy (Clausius, 1897) and information theoretic entropy\n(Shannon and Weaver, 1949), constraining our discussion to the context of an\noperational equivalence (in healthy systems) between gain of information and\n238\ndecrease in entropy in brain-relevant dynamical systems. As we shall see, certain\npathophysiological processes appear to manifest themselves as reductions in\nbackground or “resting” state entropy which then limits its supply with respect to\ninformation gain and/or transport. Relationships between “physical” thermodynamic\nobservables, such as changes in heat capacity or temperature dependence of\nkinetic constants, and information-transport driven, neurotransmitter evoked\nconformational changes in neural membrane proteins may someday come together\nin an experimentally productive way (Hitzemann et al, 1985; Zeman et al, 1987;\nBorea et al, 1988), but they are beyond the scope of this paper.\nThe idea of taming the orbit of an expanding flow (with at least one λ( + )) by\npartitioning the geometric space supporting its actions, its “manifold,” and then\nlabeling each box so that its trajectory is representable by a symbol string of box\nindices is the way “symbolic dynamics” are applied to dynamical systems. Symbolic\ndynamics arose in pure mathematics in the context of obtaining a one-to-one,\ntopological (sequence not distance preserving ) representation of a difficult to\ncharacterize system of “geodesics on surfaces of negative curvature” (Hadamard,\n1898; Morse, 1917; Morse and Hedlund, 1938). Geodesics here are the shortest\nlines in this curved, non-Euclidean space in which nearby lines spread apart and far\naway ones came together with (in Euclidian space) parallel lines meeting at infinity.\nRemarkably, symbolic dynamic encoding of the motions on this abstract\nmanifold of negative curvature also capture how uniformly divergent (and\nconvergent), “hyperbolic” chaotic systems, such as brain systems, behave in\nEuclidean space, an intuitive similarity about which Poincare experienced his\nfamous vacation bus trip epiphany (Stillwell, 1985). It should also be noted that\nencoding neural spike trains in one dimension for symbolic dynamical comparisons\nof sequence structure and recurrances, “favored patterns” has been developed\nindependently of orbital dynamics on manifolds (Dayhoff, 1984; Dayhoff and\nGerstein, 1983a; 1983b). A similar approach has been used to characterize firing\npatterns and their response to acupuncture in dopamine neurons in the substantia\nnigra and hypothalamic neurons (Chen and Ku, 1992).\n239\nFor real neurobiological data, a time series and its n time delays are first\nreconstructed as a trajectory in an n+1 dimensional geometric embedding space\nand, following partition of that geometric space into n+1 dimensional lettered boxes\n(the choice of partition being a sensitive step), what was once an orbit has become\na sequence of symbols. Dynamical systems in geometric space become symbolic\ndynamics in sequence space. It was Kolmogoroff (1958) who first applied\nShannon’s ideas of entropy and information (Shannon and Weaver, 1949; Khinchin,\n1957) to the quantification of these dynamical system’s telegraphic messages as\ndiscrete, “stochastic” (random, probabilistic) output. Kolmogoroff turned to Shannon\nentropy,\n−∑ p i\nlog p i\n(where p = 1/n and n = number of possibilities) to decide the\nquestion whether a dynamical system that naturally partitioned into a two or three\nbox system per unit time had the same entropy. His answer was no, that –3(1/3 ln\n(1/3)) = 1.098 > -2(1/2 ln (1/2) = 0.6931 loge and in computer relevant log 2 , 1.5850 >\n1.0 (Kolmogorov, 1959). Entropy increases with possibility.\nNonlinear differential equations representing brain-relevant expanding\ndynamical systems replace Shannon’s linguistically weighted and serially ordered,\nMarkoff-dependent random number generator of probabilistic language. As noted\nabove, in the case of the Sharkovskii sequences (Sharkovskii, 1964; Metropolis et\nal, 1973; Misiurewicz, 1995), a small change in the single parameter of an entire\nclass of single maximum maps generating motions that are coded from their\nposition at the left or right of center of the unit interval, alters and determines\nprecisely the periodic output such as {1,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1…) of its binary\nmessage. In higher dimensional examples such as the Rössler and Lorenz\nsystems, one can visualize the joint actions of λ( + ) and λ( − ) moving the trajectory\nso as to both enter, “create,” new boxes and generate new letters as well as visit old\nones, unstable fixed points, thus forming unstable periodic orbits. The latter, one of\nthree diagnostic features of chaotic attractors (see above), can also be seen as\nresulting from the “coarse-grained” imprecision of real world neurobiological\nmeasurement such that two points that are brought close to attractive-repelling\npoints are, within measurement error, recorded as having the same value.\n240\nProblems of measurement precision, amplified by the expansive actions of\nsystems that are sensitive to initial conditions, yield parameter sensitive entropies of\ntwo (mathematically) fundamental kinds called topological and metric entropies, h T\nand h M , proven to be the upper and lower bounds of any estimate of the entropy in a\nuniformly expanding and/or equidistributed system (Adler and Weiss, 1965).\nMeasures of entropy, as “missing information related to the number of alternatives\nwhich remain possible to a physical system” (Boltzmann, 1909), “index of\nprobability” (Gibbs, 1902) or the “amount of uncertainty associated with a finite\nscheme” (Khinchin,1957) are obviously sensitive to the partition rules and its\nfineness of the grain. The most theoretically defensible partition is called the\n“generating partition” in which no box contains more than one point. Comparisons of\ncontrol and experimental data can be differentially sensitive to partition construction,\nso that if a generating partition is not practicable due to sample length or dense\ncurdling in the point distribution, some arbitrary choices have to be made. These\nhave included naturally renormalized variational partitions, such that in one\ndimension the boxes are defined by ±1, ±2, ±3,…standard deviations, or quartiles or\nquintile, above and below the mean and in n dimensions. Partitions have also been\nconstructed and used to described drug effects on rat exploratory behavior by\nsequential partitioning along the dimension of the highest remaining variation (after\nthe previous partition) called the “KD” partition (Paulus et al, 1991). Partition\nstrategies to capture entropic measures on serial ordering (Klemm and Sherry,\n1981; Strong et al, 1998) can grow from knowledge or hypotheses about the\nphysiological sources of temporal irregularities and discontinuities in brain dynamics\nincluding characteristic interval(s) of refractoriness, relaxation times of the inhibitory\nsurround, correlation time in dendritic tree summation, the time course of reciprocal\ninhibition and its decay and chemical influences such as the synaptic half-life and\ntime of action of inhibitory influences such as GABA on cell firing.\nThe logarithmic growth rates of occupancy of new symbolically indexed\nboxes or, equivalently, the growth rates of visitations to old ones generating\nunstable periodic orbits, are called topological entropies, h T . They record new\nhappenings, the growth rate of the diversity of orbits, and not how likely with respect\n241\nto box occupancy densities they are likely to occur ( Adler et al, 1964; Alexeev and\nJacobson, 1981; Cornfield et al, 1982; Ornstein, 1989; Ruelle, 1990). The close\nrelationships in real brain observables between the appearance rate of new\nsymbols or new unstable periodic orbits, h T , and log λ( + ), reflecting the rate of\ndivergence from the next expected value generating a new, unexpected value, is\nnot surprising. In fact, a maximal estimate of the entropy of a dynamical system, h T\n= log λ( + ) whereas the largest value that h M can attain is log(#of states). A great\ndeal of substantial mathematics has gone into proofs that similarities (“equivalence\nrelations”) and differences between dynamical patterns are robustly indicated by\ndifferences in h T and h M (Adler et al, 1977; Adler and Marcus, 1979).\nIf the sum of the densities in each j box were normalized so as to sum to 1.0,\nsuch that each is a probability, p j , then - Σ p j log p j represents the metric entropy,\nh M . h M was first described in the dynamical context by Kolmogorov (1958;1959).\nThe sum having a –1 prefactor converts the negative log of < 1 to a meaningful\npositive value in the expression. h M is maximal for the equidistributed, uniformly\nexpansive, C or Axiom A systems (see above). As noted above, generally h T = the\nmaximum estimate of the entropy and h M the minimum estimate (Adler and Weiss,\n1965). h T = h M in uniformly hyperbolic systems (Bowen, 1975) and the difference,\n|h T – h M | is an index of non-uniformity found useful in discriminating among classes\nof single neurons from their discharge patterns (Mandell, 1987; Selz and Mandell,\n1992; Mandell and Selz, 1993; Mandell and Selz, 1997a). These measures applied\nto temporal and spatial patterns of rat exploratory behavior have been used to\ndiscriminate among stimulant drug effects (Paulus et al, 1990; Paulus and Geyer,\n1992). Similar computations involving the symbolic dynamics and disallowed\ntransitions have been used to study the complexity of the the EEG (Xu, 1994) in\nwhich both extremely low (fixed point, periodic) and high (Gaussian random)\nentropies are seen as manifesting low “complexity as a function of the diversity of\nthe available patterns of behavior (Crutchfield and Young, 1989a).\nBefore describing the simple but definitional matrix operations for h T and h M\nbelow which might seem forbidding to those “not up on their linear algebra,” we note\n242\nthat procedures such exponentiation of a matrix can be carried out automatically\nusing computer algebra programs such as Maple or for data processing available as\ncomputational modules in MatLab.\nOne of the techniques for the computation of h T involves determining the\nlogarithm of the asymptotic growth rate of the major diagonal (“trace”) in the\ntransition matrix symbolically encoding the trajectory which would therefore count\nthe “self visitations” of each indexed boxes as the dynamics proceed. This involves\nsetting up a transition incidence matrix, each box scored for a disallowed, 0, or\nallowed, 1, transitions and the matrix is exponentiated t times with the logarithm of\nthe asymptotic growth rate of the sum of the diagonal values serving as a (leading\neigenvalue) estimate of h T . More technical considerations involving the Frobenius-\nPerron theorem guaranteeing the existence of such an logarithmic index of new\ninformation generation rates, even in random matrices (Seneta, 1981), will not be\ndiscussed here.\nWe have found that computing h T in this way is empirically useful for difficult\nto obtain or only transiently stationary brain data series. Even with relatively short\nsamples lengths, if one is willing to make the pragmatic assumption of “temporary\nstationarity” or “things as they are right now will, for the sake of argument, go on\nforever” (perhaps the best we can do with intrinsically transient brain phenomena)\nthen this “freeze framed” representation of reality yields an asymptotic measure on\nrelatively short sample lengths since they are computationally infinite. A similar\napproach to h M , requires repeatedly exponentiating a Markoff matrix constructed\nfrom relatively short samples and generates the probabilistic (eigenvector) “dual” of\nh T. h M computed in this way serves as a useful quantity, h M called by some the\nKolmogorov entropy in comparisons of control and experimental conditions of the\nsame sample lengths. Systematic decreases in h M (“Kolmogorov entropy”) have\nbeen shown to accompany increasing “depth” of sleep using standard sleep staging\ntechniques (Gallez and Babloyantz, 1991) and increases in h M were associated with\nboth positive and negative emotional states induced by movies (Aftanas et al,\n1997).\n243\nh T and λ( + ) have been analogized to what is called algorithmic complexity,\nwhich quantifies a computer algorithm’s minimal representation of a symbol\nsequence as it grows longer (Chaitin, 1974; Bennett, C.H., 1982; Nicolis, 1986;\nRissanen, 1982; Crutchfield and Young, 1989b). Examples of applications of a\npseudocomputational compression scheme have quantified differences among\nprotein sequences (Ebling and Jimenez-Montano, 1980), discriminated therapistdirected\n“transference” manifestations in verbally encoded processes in\npsychotherapy (Rapp et al, 1991), characterized neural spike train patterns in a\npenicillin kindled spike focus (Rapp et al, 1994), differentiated among spike\nsequence patterns of biogenic amine families of brain stem neurons (Mandell and\nSelz, 1994) and as a sample length-dependent rate, in content-free, mouse driven\ncomputer tasks differentiated borderline from obsessive-compulsive personality\npatterns (Selz and Mandell, 1997).\nComputation of lexical complexity is a good example of this approach. This\nprocedure recursively surveys the sequence of symbols for the longest word, where\n“words” are subsequences that appear at least three times if they contain two letters\nor at least twice if they contain more than two letters. Upon finding a longest\nrepeated word, the compression algorithm replaces all occurances of this word with\na single distinct (new) symbol and looks again for the longest repeated word in the\nmodified sequence. When the sequence cannot be further recursively compressed,\nthere may remain identical adjacent symbols in the sequence. These are coded as\nthe symbol raised to the power of the number of its adjacent occurances. This\nexponent cannot exceed five because six adjacent identical symbols would be two\noccurances of a three letter word. The numerical value of the lexical complexity is\nsimply the sum of the number of distinct symbols and the (sum of the) logarithm of\nthe exponents of the symbol sequences (Ebling and Jimenez-Montano, 1980).\nA clear account of algorithmic and lexical complexity in relationship to other\nmeasures of “complexity” in the context of brain relevant research data can be\nfound in Rapp and Schmah (1996). The relationship between thermodynamic and\nergodic, measure theories in relationship to forced-dissipative dynamics and the\n244\nrole of self-intersection on manifolds in this new source of irreversibility (with a\nresulting “arrow of time”) is developed in Mackey (1992).\nAs noted, the skeleton which configures attractors is composed of unstable,\n“saddle” fixed points, each of which attract (iron down) the trajectory along one\ndimension and repel or spread it out along another. Systems fulfilling the criteria for\na chaotic dynamical system have the property of a countably infinite number of\nunstable periodic orbits composed of these unstable fixed points. Depending upon\nparameters, the orbital points can pull up their tails to be discrete with respect to\neach other or spread along the unstable direction to connect smoothly with others\nalong a curve such as a saddle cycle. Parametric control of the strengths and\nstructures of the saddle point skeleton of typical attractors can be used to change\nboth the rate of generation of novel symbols as well as recurrances to old ones in\nthe symbolic dynamics generating a brain dynamical system’s lexagraphic products\n(Bowen, 1978; Alexeev and Jacobson, 1981)).\nUsing a variety of techniques to algorithmically register “return times,”\nexperimental condition-sensitive “saddle orbits” composing unstable periodic orbits\nhave been demonstrated in geometric reconstructions of real data series generated\nby a 40+ component chemical reaction (Lathrop and Kostelich, 1989), in response\nto natural stimuli in the time dependent behavior of the crayfish caudal\nphotoreceptor (Pei and Moss, 1996) and in the interburst interval sequences\nrecorded in hippocampal slices of the rat (So et al, 1997; So et al, 1998). If the\nreader uses the software listed above to simulate the time evolution of one of these\nattractors of abstract or real systems , she will learn that a remarkably small number\nof points, a very short time sample, will outline, “shadow” (Bowen, 1978), the\ncomplete array of unstable fixed points before filling in the attractor. It is tempting to\nspeculate about the potential nervous system relevance of this dynamical\nanticipation of the attractor’s recognizable geometry, as well as a precis of what the\nsymbolic dynamics are going to say occurs many time steps before filling in the\nattractor and its asymptotic message. Values of the measures made on the early\nunstable periodic orbit arrays such h T , h M and λ( + ), resemble very closely those\n245\nmade on their attractors when they were much more densely filled (Lathrop and\nKostelich , 1989). Bowen’s “shadow lemma” in support of a thin film of points over\nthe skelton of unstable fixed points of attractors is the fundamental reason that short\nsample length time series can often discriminate between control and experimental\nconditions in brain research studies.\nAnother recently implemented entropy, called “approximate entropy,” is\nexploiting the underlying unstable fixed point skeletal shadowing principle in\nexpansive dynamical systems to find statistically significant differences between\ncontrol and experimental results in reasonably short, physiologically realistic,\nsample lengths (Pincus, 1991; Pincus et al, 1991). This algorithm is somewhat\nderivative of those involved in the computation of the correlation dimension (see\nabove). Instead of computing across a range (and taking the limits) of embedding\ndimensions, d, and sequential paired-vectorial distances, ε, it empirically tailors and\nfixes them to compute a “logarithmic likelihood” that points remains close through\nincremental change in the time series. The “approximate entropy” is not easily\nrelatable to either h T and h M. One is tempted to predict that this geometrically\noriented algorithm might be fooled into a postive entropy diagnosis if applied to\nstrange, nonchaotic dynamical systems with fractal dimension but no λ( + ) -related\nmixing. Since sequence position is conserved in this computation, two\nsimultaneously studied (“multiparameter”) systems can be examined for their mutual\ncoherence as the “cross approximate entropy.” Among the interesting findings from\napplications of this index to neuroendocrine studies are an increase in approximate\nentropy in LH and FSH secretory patterns with age in both sexes, perhaps\nquantitatively heralding menopause (Pincus and Minkin, 1998) and decreased cross\napproximate entropy, a decrease in regulatory coupling between ACTH and cortisol\nsecretion patterns in patients with Cushing’s syndrome (Roelfsema et al, 1998).\nAmong the many of other empirically derived entropies, one is called “power\nspectral entropy,” which is equivalent to the normalized variance of the distribution\nof frequencies in a power spectral transformation of a time series (Farmer et al,\n1980). This has been successfully applied to brain enzyme and receptor fluctuations\n246\n(Russo and Mandell, 1984a; Mandell, 1984), and, more recently, to multiple\nsimultaneously EEG leads which demonstrated focal increases in epileptic patients\n(Inouye et al, 1991; 1992). An entropy derived from the quantification of the failures\nin temporal forecasting of EEG signals increased in the fronto-temporal region with\ndrug treatment in patients with Alzheimer’s syndrome (Pezard et al, 1998).\nWith respect to their implications for the clinical neurosciences, changes in\ndynamical entropy in behavior of brain dynamical systems has been regarded in two\ngeneral ways: (1) Since representation of information requires the resolution of\nrelevant ambiguity, a nonrelevant and global reduction in the dynamical entropy of a\nbrain system (Stage IV sleep EEG slow waves, neuronal fixed point or regularly\nperiodic activity, extrapyramidal motor tremor, fixed paranoid or obsessional\nmentation, the actions of some anxiolytics and antipsychotics ) reduces its potential\nfor information encoding and transport. In contrast, “arousal” induced increases in\nthe measures of entropy in brain wave and neuronal discharge patterns (pre-task\nwarning signals, motivating conditions, stimulant drugs) are associated with\nimproved psychophysical receptive and discrimination functions, learning rates and\nmemory. (2) Regarding as potentially pathophysiological both of the two extremes\nof entropy generation, fixed point and periodic behavior as the lowest and fair coin\nflipping, “Bernoulli” randomness as the highest, another descriptor, “complexity” is\ndefined as maximal (optimal) midway through the entropy range, making a new kind\nof parabolic entropy curve (Bennett, 1986; Crutchfield and Young, 1989a).\nIn analogy with an optimal amalgam of periodic rotations and coin flips, in\nhigher dimension, the most meaningful maximum complexity of real, nonuniformly\nexpansive processes may derive from a multiplicity of measure invariants,\nsymmetries, of the system such as the growth rate of unstable periodic orbits,\ndivergence of the tail of a density distribution and specifiable linguistic variables\nsuch as word length and redundancy. The more symmetries, the more potential for\ncomplicated information encoding and transport with the maximum complexity\nlocated midrange in each one. We have pursued the hypothesis that entropy is a\nconserved property in the healthy brain and that complementarity in other statistical\nmeasure mechanisms make that possible. For example, in uniformly expansive,\n247\nidealized systems, topological entropy has been proven be equivalent to the product\nof an index of expansion and the dimension of the support such that an increase in\nexpansiveness , λ( + ), is compensated by a decrease in D 0 leaving h T invariant\n(Manning,1981). This relationship has also been found in the behavior of some\nnonuniformly expansive neuroendocrine, neuronal and human behavioral systems\n(Mandell and Selz, 1995; Smotherman et al, 1996; Mandell and Selz, 1997a;).\nIs Randomness Versus Determinism a Productive Question for the Biological\nSciences? Are There Better Ones?\nMeasures made on realistically nonuniformly expansive behavior of\ndynamical systems emerging from nonlinear differential equations and that arising\nfrom a variety of non-classical random walk models overlap such that making what\nmay be more a metaphysical discrimination at this point is labor intensive,\ncontentious and unproductive for generating new experimental work in the\nneurosciences. It is important to note that random walk theory and computation has\nmatured to such an extent that almost any “nonlinear dynamical behavior” can, with\nrespect to statistical measure, be modeled using one of many varieties. For\nexamples, power law distributions in continuous time random walks (times of\nmovement are also randomly chosen) , random walks with traps (temporarily\nimmobilizing the trajectory like unstable fixed points), random walks in random\nenvironments, time of passage of ants in a labyrinth and Levy leaps and local\ndiffusive exploration (looking for a wallet) among many others can represent much\nof the irregular behavior we observe in the brain (Shlesinger et al, 1982; Montroll\nand Shlesinger, 1984; Hughes, 1995; Klafter et al, 1996). On the other hand,\n(Markoff) partition of the sequence and a probabilistic style of analysis of nonlinear\ndynamical systems has been a major strategy for description and quantification\nfrom the field’s beginnings (Parry, 1964; Adler and Weiss, 1967; Bowen, 1970;\nLasota and Yorke, 1973). The issue of randomness versus determinism remains\ncurrent although many if not most properties of deterministic dynamical systems can\n248\nbe simulated with a suitably constructed random process and all of our random\nnumber generators are deterministic.\nThis theoretical blind alley is reminiscent of the decades lost partialing out\ncausal attributes of nature versus nurture before knowledge of dynamical influences\non nucleotide dynamics was available. It is perhaps unfortunate that for finite length\nreal data, “house keeping requirements” (Ruelle, 1990; Rapp, 1993;1994) and\n“warnings on the label” with various random sequence, random phase controls\n(“surrogate data”) have become so intimidating to those of us in the early stages of\nexploring the use of these theories and methods in the brain sciences. Currently the\n“controls” are more relevant to abstract statistical processes and what can be said\nabout them rather than generating and addressing new claims and the controls for\nthem related to quantitatively oriented, experimental brain physiology.\nStatistical caveats have arisen to retard the emergence of potentially\nimportant and robust neurophysiologically-relevant phenomena. For example, a\nrecent well conducted and analyzed study of the influence of low doses of ethanol in\n32 normal male subjects, which honored almost all of the current analytic rituals\nincluding sequence and phase randomized surrogate data and searches for the\ncontinuity features of deterministic dynamical systems such as time asymmetry,\nconcluded that the drug “reduced the evidence for nonlinear dynamical structure” in\nthe brain (Ehlers et al, 1998). Though honoring the currently popular statistical\nrituals, what appears to be missing here are suggestions for new neurobiological or\nmathematical intuitions that will lead to the design of the next experiment.\nWe now see that it is now possible to use these new ideas and methods to\nask and at least partially answer more specific questions relevant to the clinically\noriented neurosciences such as: whether increases in lithium-induced\nexpansiveness and mixing in the dynamics of brain enzymes, neurons and behavior\nhelp explicate a mechanism of de-coherence in bipolar disease (Mandell et al,\n1985); do these approaches to membrane conductance fluctuations suggest a new\nway to think about ion channel dynamics (Liebovitch, 1990); can alcohol-induced\nchanges in statistical dynamics of the EEG predict genetic predilection in males to\n249\nalcoholism (Ehlers et al, 1995); do these approaches suggest a new neural\ndynamical mechanism for the actions of anticonvulsant drugs (Zimmerman et al,\n1991); can these measures made on non-verbal, psychomotor tasks yield a nonintrusive\nmeasure of personality and character (Selz, 1992); can these approaches\nto deviant patterns of psychomotor sequencing in schizophrenics give us some\ninsight into potential (cerebeller-basal ganglia?) mechanisms of the thought disorder\nin schizophrenia (Paulus et al, 1994); does cocaine induce new patterns of behavior\nthat conserve pre-treatment entropy in developing animals (Smotherman et al,\n1996); will these quantities applied to objective gait observables supply early\ndiagnoses and quantification of clinical course in patients with extra-pyramidal\ndisorders or taking anti-psychotic medication (Hausdorff et al, 1998); can these\ntransformations of time series on the EEG give us an early diagnostic approach to\nAlzheimer’s disease (Jeong et al, 1998) or a new acute preventive pharmacological\napproach to patients with psychomotor and partial seizures (Iasemidis et al, 1990).\nTo end where we began: We think that if neuroscientists “did their own”\nnonlinear dynamical theory and analysis, shaped and tailored by intuitions growing\nout of their own experimental work and thinking, abstract and philosophical\nquestions about what is determinism and what is random would retreat in favor of\nnew specific ideas and experiments about brain dynamical mechanisms and their\npathophysiology. From the studies reviewed here, it appears that a robust move in\nthis direction in the brain sciences is well underway.\n250\nReferences\nAasen,T.,Kugiumtzis,D.,Nordahl,G.
