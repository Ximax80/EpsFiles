Russell\nand Spike Jones\nPeggy Siegal and\nCatherine Martin\nSuki Waterhouse\nand Bradley\nCooper\nThis was the year absolutely no one could predict Best\nPicture for the 86th Academy Awards: not even me, the\nOscar witch. This made directors Steve McQueen,\nAlfonso Cuaron and David O. Russell very crazy. After\nmonths of screenings, press conferences, lunches, and\nparties, publicists and bloggers had to look these three wise\nmen in the eye and say, “We don’t have a clue.”\nThen came the slogan, “It’s time.” That was\nFox Searchlight’s last suggestion on 12 Years\na Slave advertisements that subliminally\nregistered in the hearts and minds of voters\nin the closing days of the studio’s low-key\ncampaign.\n“It’s time.” So simple. Says it all. Just like\nthe mantra “Find your voice” that marketing\nhoncho Harvey Weinstein came up with\nthree years ago, which drove The King’s Speech\nto a win.\nThis is how you win an Oscar. You pinpoint\nand connect an exact emotion on the screen to\nan exact emotion that moves 6,000 voters who\nare mostly very smart white middle-aged guys.\nOn Oscar night, host Ellen DeGeneres joked\nto 43 million viewers, “Possibility number one:\n12 Years a Slave wins Best Picture. Possibility\nnumber two: You’re all racists,” answering\nthe question three hours before the win was\nannounced. DeGeneres then gifted sponsor\nSamsung with the world’s most famous selfie\nand tipped a pizza delivery guy $1,000.\nThe gripping 12 Years a Slave won Best\nPicture, putting Steve McQueen in the history\nbooks as the first black director, who is also\nBritish, to win an Oscar.\nIt took the star power of white heartthrob\nBrad Pitt to get the film financed. Taking\nthe small but heroic role as the slave’s savior,\nBrad then took a backseat by shooting WWII\nfilm, Fury in England, leaving the promotion\nto others.\nSteve McQueen’s muse Michael Fassbender,\nwho portrayed a sadistic plantation owner,\nannounced he would not campaign. McQueen,\nChiwetel Ejiofor and an unknown supporting\nactress, Lupita Nyong’o, were left with the\nherculean task of selling a film about slavery that\nwas guaranteed to embarrass every American.\nThis is why their win was so poignant.\nWarner Bros.’ wildly popular Gravity had\nskyrocketed to $1 billion globally at the box\noffice. This technical game changer propelled\nSandra Bullock into outer space with $70\nmillion of backend profits tucked into her\nspace panties. The beloved thriller landed\ntriumphantly with seven Oscars. Alfonso\nCuarón, who slaved for four years to create\nhis masterpiece, won two statues for directing\nand editing and became the first Latino\ndirector to win. Although Gravity’s producer\nDavid Heyman did not strike gold, this film\nwas one hell of a second act after producing\nall those Harry Potter films.\nIn the past four years, David O. Russell\nhas been a serious contender with 25 total\nnominations for his last three films. Hilarious\nand astute American Hustle garnered 10\nnominations, but no wins this year.\nThe four acting categories were easy to\npredict. Cate Blanchett wowed the minute\nBlue Jasmine was released in July. This\ninstantaneous phenomenon is known as the\n“Colin-Firth-Daniel-Day-Lewis slam dunk.”\nIn November, beautiful darling Jared Leto\nstole everybody’s hearts dressed as a woman\nin Dallas Buyers Club. His long hair, penchant\nfor ’90s grunge, and rock band 30 Seconds to\nMars, made him another instant winner.\nMatthew McConaughey’s career renaissance\nbecame “McConaissance.” Mud, Dallas Buyer’s\nClub, Wolf of Wall Street, and finally HBO’s\n© Copyright 2013 startraksphoto.com and BFAnyc.com\n54 | AVENUE MAGAZINE • APRIL 2012\n© Copyright 2013 startraksphoto.com and BFAnyc.com\nTrue Detective collectively earned him Best\nActor by December.\nThe actress who really stole the show\non the campaign circuit was eloquent\ningénue Lupita Nyong’o, who morphed into\na fashion goddess. No one will forget her\nBest Supporting Actress acceptance speech\nwhen she said, “It doesn’t escape me for one\nmoment that so much joy in my life is thanks\nto so much pain in someone else’s.”\nTuesday, February 25\nI flew to L.A. with some indefinable eye\ninfection that made Olympics reporter Bob\nCostas’ reaction to Botox look attractive. My\nmedical calamity possibly caused by Latisse,\nwhich promotes eyelash growth, caused\nmy eyelids to resemble red golf balls and\nnecessitated the wearing of dark glasses.\nNo, I did not look as cool as Anna Wintour.\nI managed to grope my way through Oscar\nweek in couture Ralph Rucci gowns and furs\nand pretend temporary blindness was “just a\nnew look.”\nOn this, my 30th trip to The Beverly Hills\nHotel, the famous Polo Lounge had finally\nbeen renovated to look exactly like it did\n30 years ago so as not to upset the regulars.\nEach pool cabana now had giant flat screens\ninstalled for watching CNN in the sun. Cate\nBlanchett and Oprah Winfrey were the hot\nOscar week guests.\nI headed over to the Vanity Fair Social Club,\nwith its media-friendly “WeWork Hollywood”\npop-up lounge. Vanity Fair publisher Ed\nMenicheschi, who perfected the Midas touch\nfor masterminding Oscar week sponsorship,\ngreeted me. I participated in a panel discussion\nof Oscar prognosticators about who would\nwin, hosted by Michael Hogan of VF.com with\nAnne Thompson of IndieWire, Sasha Stone\nof Awards Daily, Pete Hammond of Deadline,\nDave Karger of Fandango, Krista Smith of\nVanity Fair, and Kyle Buchanan of Vulture.\nIf you had put fire to our feet we could not\ntell you who was winning Best Picture. Like a\nbunch of nerds all trying to impress each other,\nwe did predict every other category correctly.\nThe town was crawling with stars. So it\nwasn’t shocking to find the most famous\nsitting in the middle of a public restaurant\ndrinking and singing oldies by the Eagles\nand Neil Diamond. That was the scene at\nNobu in L.A. where Bono and U2, here to\nperform Mandela’s theme “Ordinary Love”\nat the Oscars, sat drinking sake and George\nClooney’s Casamigos Tequila with Clooney\nhimself, and Cindy Crawford and Rande\nGerber as they all belted out songs.\nSteve McQueen\nwith Bianca\nStigter\nJennifer\nLawrence\nBrad Pitt and\nAngelina Jolie\nGeorge left town soon after, was rumored\nto stop in London to see his new girlfriend,\nOxford-educated British barrister Amal\nAlamuddin, and they headed to an exotic,\nsecluded island for a much-deserved vacation.\nAfter winning the Oscar last year for producing\nArgo, George had a supporting role in Gravity;\nco-produced August: Osage County; and\nstarred in Tomorrowland, which Disney will\nrelease in 2015. He also produced, wrote,\ndirected, and acted in The Monuments Men.\nClooney marched to Berlin, Milan, London,\nand Paris, successfully opening that film.\nWith his Oscar night absence, not only did\nhe make sure Sandra Bullock got all the credit\nshe deserved, but my hunch is that he was\nalso quietly proud of his good friend Brad\nPitt, who produced 12 Years a Slave, Gravity’s\nbiggest competition.\nWednesday, February 26\nAction central was now in the lobby\nof Chateau Marmont where Vanity Fair,\nGraydon Carter, and Benedikt Taschen\nAlfonso Cuaron\nLupita Nyong’o\nhonored world-class photographer Annie\nLeibovitz for the launch of her new sumosized\nbook, Annie Leibovitz.\nAndré Balazs confided that Annie pulled\nan all-nighter in her pajamas hanging her\nwork. Balazs gave her free reign to install\nher huge iconic portraits throughout the\nhallways and first floor suites that were open\nduring the party.\nPhotographers Mario Testino and Terry\nRichardson browsed as Annie walked\nQuincy Jones on a tour of her larger-thanlife\nexhibition. Sylvester Stallone gazed at his\nown portrait taken 20 years ago, his Dorian\nGray Rocky face now frozen—as in Botox—\nnot the blockbuster animated Disney winner.\nParamount CEO Brad Grey’s wife\nCassandra, Carole Bayer Sager and Lorraine\nSchwartz gave a private dinner at Cassandra’s\nViolet Grey store on Melrose. Jack Nicholson,\nseated with model Erin Wasson and Eva\nMendes, held court as superstar Pharrell\nWilliams (in his Vivienne Westwood\n“Mountain” hat) and Anjelica Huston chatted\nPortia de\nRossi and Ellen\nDeGeneres\nBono\nMichael Fassbender\nSienna\nMiller\nLeonardi\nDiCaprio\nMatthew\nMcConaughey and\nCamila Alves\nup Chinatown producer Robert Evans. Dom\nPerignon sent the champagne, proving that even\nbehind private dinners, one can now spot a sponsor.\nThursday, February 27\nOprah Winfrey slipped into Essence’s “Black\nWomen in Hollywood” lunch at the Beverly Hills\nHotel where Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the first black\nfemale president of the Academy, was honored\nwith a Trailblazer Award.\nPresident Bill Clinton, in town for the\nfirst United4Humanity gala at Sony Studios\nthat night, had lunch at Larry Gagosian’s\nmagnificent modern home in Holmby Hills.It\nwas designed by architect A. Quincy Jones, the\nmentor of Frank Gehry—not to be confused\nwith music legend Quincy Jones, the mentor\nof Michael Jackson. On this night, there were\nBarry Diller\nand Diane von\nFurstenberg\n56 | AVENUE MAGAZINE • APRIL 2012\nAmy Adams and\nDarren Le Gallo\nLady\nGaga\nThis is how you win an\nOscar. You pinpoint\nand connect an\nexact emotion on the\nscreen to an exact\nemotion that moves\n6,000 voters . . .\n10 parties. English society decorator and Olympic\nparty animal Nicky Haslam flew in from England\nfor the Vanity Fair dinner Sunday night and was my\nescort for this evening. We made it to five parties.\nVanity Fair and Sony’s “Toast to American\nHustle” at Ago on Melrose was our first stop, to\npay homage to David O. Russell. Inquiring minds,\nincluding hotshot producer Megan Ellison,\nAmy Adams, Sony CEO Michael Lynton and\nco-chairman Amy Pascal, debated who was\nwinning Best Picture. We still didn’t know.\nCAA’s Josh Lieberman was on his way to\nICM’s John Burnham’s Santa Monica home.\n© Copyright 2013 startraksphoto.com and BFAnyc.com\nAl Pacino and David Mamet were huddled on\na couch as Spike Lee and Meredith Vieira sat\nnearby listening.\nAt Warner Bros.’ fancy private dinner for its\nnominees at the Bel Air Hotel, Nicky and I were\ngreeted by David Heyman. Executives Sue Kroll\nand Juli Goodwin brought us over to Sandra\nBullock and CEO Kevin Tsujihara. Again,\neveryone whispered, “Who is winning Best\nPicture?” Gravity’s technical wizardry, revered in\nL.A., was now thought to have the edge.\nSpike Jones arrived and was too superstitious\nto discuss his chances for Best Original Screenplay\nfor Her. He won. Don’t worry about Blue Jasmine\nfellow nominee Woody Allen; he was tap dancing\nwith Susan Stroman on Broadway, rehearsing\nBullets Over Broadway. As a man who doesn’t\nbelieve in campaigning for awards, he just might\nshow up to collect a few Tonys.\nAn exhausted Alfonso Cuarón was the last to\nappear, with girlfriend Sheherazade Goldsmith.\nHe was fighting a cold and couldn’t wait to get\nback to real, not reel, life.\nBrad Grey’s party for Paramount’s nominees\nwas in full swing at Spago Beverly Hills. The Wolf\nof Wall Street’s Marty Scorsese was huddled in\na booth with Brad, marketing maven Megan\nColligan, producer Irwin Winkler, and the\nageless Don Rickles. Jonah Hill’s buddy\nLeonardo DiCaprio had just left, as he was\ngetting a cold too, but he later showed up at the\nBel Air, where Marty was staying, to have drinks\nwith Scorsese and Cuarón in the bar.\nNebraska talent Bruce Dern, Will\nForte, June Squibb, cinematographer\nPhedon Papamichael and\nscreenwriter Bob Nelson relaxed\nsince their grueling nine-month\ncampaign, which had begun at\nCannes, was finally over.\nRon Meyer, vice\nchairman of Universal,\nhad his annual private\nparty at his Malibu home\nin honor of Graydon Carter.\nBarbra Streisand, Jim Brolin,\nJohn Travolta, Kelly Preston,\nDiane Lane, Robert Downey Jr.,\nand Paul Rudd mingled under a\ntent with interior designer Sandy\nGallin and his new husband\nBryan Fox. Ron’s daughter,\njewelry designer Jennifer Meyer,\ncame alone. It was nanny’s\nnight off, so her husband Tobey\nMaguire stayed home with the\nkids.\nLara\nSpencer\nLarry Gagosian gave his 17th\nannual art opening and dinner,\nwhich is always a hot ticket for the rich and\nhip. This year, art photographer Taryn Simon\nmounted a show titled “Birds of the West Indies”\nafter the seminal taxonomy by ornithologist\nJames Bond. The exhibition also chronicled the\nwomen, weapons, and cars depicted in the Bond\nfilms, in addition to the birds that appear in all 24\nmovies. Even MGM couldn’t dream this up.\nDinner followed next door at Mr. Chow’s,\ncomplete with Eva and Michael Chow. Simon’s\nfilmmaker husband Jake Paltrow brought his\nmother Blythe Danner and his sister Gwyneth.\nSince the Spielbergs and the Paltrows are\nclose family friends , Kate Capshaw arrived with\nTheo and Sasha Spielberg. Jared Leto came\nwith Terry Richardson. Adrien Brody, Elle\nFanning, Cameron Diaz, John Waters, and\nRobbie Robertson chowed down. Power\ncollectors Eli and Edythe Broad and Bill\nand Maria Bell split chopsticks.\nAfter dinner, we migrated to Gagosian’s\nhome. It was raining, it was windy, and\nit was cold. Teetotaler Robbie Robertson\nslipped on wet stone outside the house. He\nwas taken to the hospital that night and\nendured a two-hour operation on three\nbroken ankle bones. Simultaneously,\nNicky Haslam slipped onto a glass table\nand crashed to the floor. Nicky was fine;\nthe table was a goner—so much excitement\nfor one night.\nFriday, February 28\nWoke up this morning and the eye problem\nhad reached epic proportions as my left eye\nwas now shut. Found an eye doctor to lance the\ninfected eyelid. He gave me enough drugs to get\nme to the Publicist Guild lunch at the Beverly\nWilshire Hotel. Jerry Lewis was receiving\na Lifetime Achievement Award from Carol\nBurnett. Thankfully, I only needed one eye to\ntake all that in.\nAt her uncle’s Rodeo Drive store, Roberta\nArmani toasted fellow Italians Marty Scorsese\nand Paolo Sorrentino. The suits Leo wore in\nThe Wolf of Wall Street were designed for him by\nArmani himself.\nPaolo Sorrentino was the overwhelming\nfavorite to win Best Foreign Film for his Felliniinspired\nThe Great Beauty, and indeed he won.\nArmani’s talent turnout was very impressive.\nCate Blanchett, who has signed with the designer\nas the face of his perfume, was there with Glenn\nClose, Robert DeNiro, and Samuel L. Jackson.\nAll were bedecked in Armani.\nWanda McDaniel, the marketing guru for\nArmani, was the very first to dress actresses on\nthe red carpet. Jodie Foster was her muse and\nthat was 25 years ago.\nGreta\nGerwig\nBette Midler\nLaura Dern, Bruce Dern\nand Andrea Beckett\nAPRIL 2012 • AVENUE MAGAZINE | 57\nHarvey Weinstein and\nGeorgina Chapman\nNaomi\nWatts\nGraydon Carter and\nAnna Scott Carter\nAndre Balazs\nSandra Bullock\nTerry Richardson\nI never tire of the overwhelming\nexcitement, throngs of eager press,\nand screaming fans. Everything boils\ndown to this moment of mass hysteria.\nPhilomena producers Gaby Tana and\nTracey Seaward invited me to Steve Coogan’s\nhome where music man Alexandre Desplat\nand Jon Hamm were having beers. Coogan\ncaptivated me with conversation of how he\nand the real Philomena Lee, who was a red\ncarpet regular, took their “full disclosure”\nadoption campaign to the Vatican, meeting\nThe Pope. Only Harvey Weinstein could\nhave pulled off that jaw-dropping marketing\nmiracle.\nTraditionally, there are three private agency\nparties on Friday night—WME, CAA, and\nUTA. They were hosted by Ari Emanuel,\nKevin Huvane, and Jim Berkus and were\npress free, leaving the stars uninhibited and\nhappy. Justin Theroux, about to explode in\nHBO’s miniseries The Leftovers, canoodled\nwith Jennifer Aniston. Past and present\nOscar nominees and winners including\nBen Affleck, Matt Damon, Oprah Winfrey,\nCharlize Theron, Sean Penn, Bradley\nCooper, Jonah Hill, Alexander Payne, Steve\nMcQueen, and Alfonso Cuarón were among\nthe evening’s migrating tribe.\nSaturday, March 1\nBarry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg\ncanceled their annual, highly anticipated\noutdoor lunch for Graydon Carter at their\nColdwater Canyon home atop a steep hill\nbecause of impending torrential rain that\nnever came. Three hundred power hungry\nshowbiz executives were sent into a tailspin\nfor an alternative activity.\nLuckily, Sony Pictures Classics’ and\nindustry icons Tom Bernard, and Michael\nBarker took pity on me and invited me to\ntheir table at the Independent Spirit Awards\nunder a wobbly tent that billowed with the\nwind in Santa Monica.\nBob Balaban and I headed to the 6th\nannual Chanel-sponsored dinner hosted\nby the debonair Charles Finch at Madeo.\nGirls donning $20k Chanel dresses included\nAnne Hathaway, Sienna Miller (with baby\ndaddy Tom Sturridge), Lily Collins, Greta\nGerwig and Poppy Delevingne. Jessica de\nRothschild and her director husband Sacha\nGervasi were in attendance as well as Adrien\nBrody, David O. Russell, Oliver Stone, Danny\nHuston, Jean Pigozzi, Ben Silverman, Peter\nMorton, and Elon Musk.\nHarvey and Bob Weinstein along with\nChopard honored their nominees, including\nthe singers in RADiUS-TWC’s Best\nDocumentary winner 20 Feet from Stardom,\nwith a seated dinner at the Montage Hotel in\nthe “Marchesa Ballroom.” (The dining room\nwas rechristened for the evening in honor\nof Harvey’s wife Georgina Chapman’s dress\nlabel.) After dinner, guests were wowed by\na performance from Weinstein’s upcoming\nBroadway musical, Finding Neverland, based\non their Oscar-nominated film about Peter\nPan creator J. M. Barrie. Celebrities Bono, U2,\nMeryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Oprah Winfrey,\nOlivia Wilde and Jason Sudeikis, Christoph\nWaltz, and Taylor Swift gave Neverland’s\nstars, Jason Alexander and Gary Barlow, a\nstanding ovation.\nSunday, March 2\nMy Oscar date this year was GMA’s\nglamorous Lara Spencer. I arrived, as usual,\ntwo hours early at the Dolby Theater in order\nto plant myself on the mother of all red carpets.\nOnly this year, I was incognito with the dark\n© Copyright 2013 startraksphoto.com and BFAnyc.com\n58 | AVENUE MAGAZINE • APRIL 2012\n© Copyright 2013 startraksphoto.com and BFAnyc.com\nglasses. I greeted each of Lara’s interviewees\nas if they were coming to my house for dinner.\nI never tire of the overwhelming excitement,\nthrongs of eager press, and screaming fans.\nEverything boils down to this moment of\nmass hysteria. It’s always humbling to stand\namong the entertainment giants, wish them\nluck and have them nervously smile back.\nIt’s the bittersweet finale when all of the\ncampaigning is over and you think you won’t\nsee them until their next movie. It’s like the\nlast day of camp.\nI was now dateless and alone as Lara Spencer\nwent home suffering from a sore throat.\nThose in the know always hang out at the\ndownstairs bar during the broadcast where\nthe sound is turned up on the flat screens.\nThis year, Cate Blanchett’s husband theater\nimpresario Andrew Upton bought me free\ndrinks. I hung out with Cate, her CAA agent\nHylda Queally, the adorable skinny Sally\nHawkins in a heavily beaded Valentino gown,\nJulia Roberts, and Tom Bernard and Michael\nBarker who have 140 career nominations and\n32 wins.\nAfter reassuring Blanchett that her\nstupendous pale beaded Armani Privé gown\nwas the best of the other girls’ pale dresses and\nthat her Oscar would pop against it, she went\non stage to win.\nWhile I was at the Oscar broadcast, 160\nVIPs at Graydon Carter’s annual Oscar\nviewing dinner were getting ready for the\nrush of a thousand more party guests. Five\nhundred limos were on the way. Those\nwho watched the awards from the beige,\ncircular dining room were Graydon’s\nfriends including: Sofia Vergara, Tom Ford,\nCarolina Herrera, Bruce Weber, Allen\nGrubman, Bob Colacello, Judd Apatow, Jeff\nKlein and John Goldwyn, Rupert Murdoch,\nSteve Newhouse, Les Moonves, and Jimmy\nBuffet.\nI ran through the Governor’s Ball and\nfound Bryan Lourd and Fox’s beloved leader\nJim Gianopulos, ushered by Fox Searchlight’s\nMichelle Hooper, sitting at Brad Pitt’s empty\ntable because everyone else was still in the\npress room doing interviews.\nI arrived at the Vanity Fair party at its new\nlocation, 8680 Sunset Boulevard, a parking lot\nthat was transformed into an airy glass dome.\nI stood in a corner, ravenously inhaling my\nIn-n-Out burger with ketchup dripping down\nmy chin and of course, Graydon—the adored\nmaestro of the week—came up and so sweetly\nwanted to know how I was doing. It’s a little\ndifficult to respond with a mouthful of food\nbehind dark glasses.\nThe stars were huddled together in groups,\nair kissing and congratulating each other. Bill\nMurray, Lupita Nyong’o, Jennifer Lawrence,\nNaomi Watts, Idina Menzel, Sarah Paulson,\nBette Midler and Lady Gaga owned the\ndance floor; Jared Leto passed his Oscar\naround so much he dropped it and it now\nsports a little dent in the head; pregnant Kerry\nWashington ate for two; and the Janes —\nFonda and Buffet—huddled on a couch,\nwhile The Great Gatsby’s production and\ncostume designer, and wife of director Baz\nLuhrmann, Catherine Martin and I posed\nwith her two Oscars. (Including the two she\nwon for Moulin Rouge, she now has four).\nEven Madonna has sponsors now. The\nmaterial girl—blinding in 1,000 carats of Neil\nLane’s diamonds—hosted her seventh annual\nawards bash at her manager Guy Oseary’s\nhome with Gucci. Originally super secret, the\nparty is now a headline on Page Six. Madonna\nmade her best effort to cream off the stars\nfrom Graydon’s party.\nIn attendance were Paul McCartney, Tom\nBrady and Gisele Bündchen, newly engaged\nAshton Kutcher and Mila Kunis, Serena\nWilliams, Prince, and Pink. Madonna closed\nout her own party by breakdancing with her\nkids and Miley Cyrus, and spinning records\nuntil 7 a.m. for Matthew McConaughey.\nMadge, short for majesty, would rather die\nthan entertain press, let alone an adorable\npublicist like moi. Last year, ever so curious,\nAnne Hathaway and Jared Leto\nCharlize Theron\nI was brought as\na guest of a guest\nonly to be frogmarched\nto the door by Oseary, the\nfurious host himself. Dear\nreaders, I did this for you. It has\ntaken me a year to admit—I was\ntoo socially traumatized to report\nmy investigative failure. I now realize that\nI was just a pawn for Oseary’s A-list purity\nfor the night. His own rock status had been\nboosted by signing Bono and U2. Thank God\nmy social stock is still otherwise intact. The\nweek before the Oscars, the real Oscar—de\nla Renta—had invited me to his beachfront\nparadise in the Dominican Republic with\nLord and Lady Astor. In June, the Duke and\nDuchess of Marlborough are expecting me at\nBlenheim Palace. So much for not making the\ncut at Madonna’s.\nOnce again, I scored a ride home on a\nfriend’s plane where my dark glasses fit right\nin. Passengers received an email that morning\nrequesting “no jeans.” I thought this was a\nbizarre fashion edict, only to find out the\nindigo dye in denim bleeds onto the jet’s white\nleather chairs.\nAs a closing to my 10th annual Oscar diary,\nI can sum up this year’s race as one of intense\nemotions and euphoric pride for our love of\nwhat Americans do best: making the most\nwonderful and culturally enlightening movies\nthat entertain the world. On to Cannes!✦\nAPRIL 2012 • AVENUE MAGAZINE | 59\n"
