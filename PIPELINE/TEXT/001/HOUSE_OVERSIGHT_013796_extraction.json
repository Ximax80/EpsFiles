I wrote it with two of my closest friends in mind, speaking directly to\nthem and their problems—problems I long had—and I focused on the unusual options that had worked\nfor me around the world.\nI certainly tried to set conditions for making a sleeper hit possible, but I knew it wasn’t likely. I hoped\nfor the best and planned for the worst.\nMay 2, 2007, I receive a call on my cell phone from my editor.\n“Tim, you hit the list.”\nIt was just past 5 P.M. in New York City, and I was exhausted. The book had launched five days\nbefore, and I had just finished a series of more than twenty radio interviews in succession, beginning at 6\nA.M. that morning. I never planned a book tour, preferring instead to “batch” radio satellite tours into 48\nhours.\n“Heather, I love you, but please don’t $#%* with me.”\n“No, you really hit the list. Congratulations, Mr. New York Times bestselling author!”\nI leaned against the wall and slid down until I was sitting on the floor. I closed my eyes, smiled, and\ntook a deep breath. Things were about to change.\nEverything was about to change.\nLifestyle Design from Dubai to Berlin\nThe 4-Hour Workweek has now been sold into 35 languages. It’s been on the bestseller lists for more\nthan two years, and every month brings a new story and a new discovery.\nFrom the Economist to the cover of the New York Times Style section, from the streets of Dubai to the\ncafes of Berlin, lifestyle design has cut across cultures to become a worldwide movement. The original\nideas of the book have been broken apart, improved, and tested in environments and ways I never could\nhave imagined.\nSo why the new edition if things are working so well? Because I knew it could be better, and there\nwas a missing ingredient: you.\nThis expanded and updated edition contains more than 100 pages of new content, including the latest\ncutting-edge technologies, field-tested resources, and—most important—real-world success stories\nchosen from more than 400 pages of case studies submitted by readers.\nFamilies and students? CEOs and professional vagabonds? Take your pick. There should be someone\nwhose results you can duplicate. Need a template to negotiate remote work, a paid year in Argentina,\nperhaps? This time, it’s in here.\nThe Experiments in Lifestyle Design blog (www.fourhourblog.com) was launched alongside the book,\nand within six months, it became one of the top 1,000 blogs in the world, out of more than 120 million.\nThousands of readers have shared their own amazing tools and tricks, producing phenomenal and\nunexpected results. The blog became the laboratory I’d always wanted, and I encourage you to join us\nthere.\nThe new “Best of the Blog” section includes several of the most popular posts from the Experiments\nin Lifestyle Design blog. On the blog itself, you can also find recommendations from everyone from\nWarren Buffett (seriously, I tracked him down and show you how I did it) to chess prodigy Josh\nWaitzkin. It’s an experimental playground for those who want better results in less time.\nNot “Revised”\nThis is not a “revised” edition in the sense that the original no longer works. The typos and small\nmistakes have been fixed over more than 40 printings in the U.S. This is the first major overhaul, but not\nfor the reason you’d expect.\nThings have changed dramatically since April 2007. Banks are failing, retirement and pension funds\nare evaporating, and jobs are being lost at record rates. Readers and skeptics alike have asked: Can the\nprinciples and techniques in the book really still work in an economic recession or depression?\nYes and yes.\nIn fact, questions I posed during pre-crash lectures, including “How would your priorities and\ndecisions change if you could never retire?” are no longer hypothetical. Millions of people have seen\ntheir savings portfolios fall 40% or more in value and are now looking for options C and D. Can they\nredistribute retirement throughout life to make it more affordable? Can they relocate a few months per\nyear to a place like Costa Rica or Thailand to multiply the lifestyle output of their decreased savings?\nSell their services to companies in the UK to earn in a stronger currency? The answer to all of them is,\nmore than ever, yes.\nThe concept of lifestyle design as a replacement for multi-staged career planning is sound. It’s more\nflexible and allows you to test different lifestyles without committing to a 10- or 20-year retirement plan\nthat can fail due to market fluctuations outside of your control. People are open to exploring alternatives\n(and more forgiving of others who do the same), as many of the other options—the once “safe” options\n—have failed.\nWhen everything and everyone is failing, what is the cost of a little experimentation outside of the\nnorm? Most often, nothing. Flash forward to 2011; is a job interviewer asking about that unusual gap\nyear?\n“Everyone was getting laid off and I had a once-in-a-lifetime chance to travel around the world. It\nwas incredible.”\nIf anything, they’ll ask you how to do the same. The scripts in this book still work.\nFacebook and LinkedIn launched in the post-2000 dot-com “depression.” Other recession-born babies\ninclude Monopoly, Apple, Cliff Bar, Scrabble, KFC, Domino’s Pizza, FedEx, and Microsoft. This is no\ncoincidence, as economic downturns produce discounted infrastructure, outstanding freelancers at\nbargain prices, and rock-bottom advertising deals—all impossible when everyone is optimistic.\nWhether a yearlong sabbatical, a new business idea, reengineering your life within the corporate beast,\nor dreams you’ve postponed for “some day,” there has never been a better time for testing the\nuncommon.\nWhat’s the worst that could happen?\nI encourage you to remember this often-neglected question as you begin to see the infinite possibilities\noutside of your current comfort zone. This period of collective panic is your big chance to dabble.\nIt’s been an honor to share the last two years with incredible readers around the world, and I hope you\nenjoy this new edition as much as I enjoyed putting it together.\nI am, and will continue to be, a humble student of you all.\nUn abrazo fuerte,\nTIM FERRISS\nSan Franciso, California\nApril 21, 2009\nFirst and Foremost\nFAQ—DOUBTERS READ THIS\nIs lifestyle design for you? Chances are good that it is. Here are some of the most common doubts\nand fears that people have before taking the leap and joining the New Rich:\nDo I have to quit or hate my job? Do I have to be a risk-taker?\nNo on all three counts. From using Jedi mind tricks to disappear from the office to designing\nbusinesses that finance your lifestyle, there are paths for every comfort level. How does a Fortune 500\nemployee explore the hidden jewels of China for a month and use technology to cover his tracks? How\ndo you create a hands-off business that generates $80K per month with no management? It’s all here.\nDo I have to be a single twenty-something?\nNot at all. This book is for anyone who is sick of the deferred-life plan and wants to live life large\ninstead of postpone it. Case studies range from a Lamborghini-driving 21-year-old to a single mother\nwho traveled the world for five months with her two children. If you’re sick of the standard menu of\noptions and prepared to enter a world of infinite options, this book is for you.\nDo I have to travel? I just want more time.\nNo. It’s just one option. The objective is to create freedom of time and place and use both however\nyou want.\nDo I need to be born rich?\nNo. My parents have never made more than $50,000 per year combined, and I’ve worked since age 14.\nI’m no Rockefeller and you needn’t be either.\nDo I need to be an Ivy League graduate?\nNope. Most of the role models in this book didn’t go to the Harvards of the world, and some are\ndropouts. Top academic institutions are wonderful, but there are unrecognized benefits to not coming out\nof one. Grads from top schools are funneled into high-income 80-hour-per-week jobs, and 15–30 years\nof soul-crushing work has been accepted as the default path. How do I know? I’ve been there and seen\nthe destruction. This book reverses it.\nMY STORY AND WHY YOU NEED THIS BOOK\nWhenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.\nAnyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination.\n—OSCAR WILDE, Irish dramatist and novelist\n—MARK TWAIN\nMy hands were sweating again.\nStaring down at the floor to avoid the blinding ceiling lights, I was supposedly one of the best in the\nworld, but it just didn’t register. My partner Alicia shifted from foot to foot as we stood in line with nine\nother couples, all chosen from over 1,000 competitors from 29 countries and four continents. It was the\nlast day of the Tango World Championship semifinals, and this was our final run in front of the judges,\ntelevision cameras, and cheering crowds. The other couples had an average of 15 years together. For us,\nit was the culmination of 5 months of nonstop 6-hour practices, and finally, it was showtime.\n“How are you doing?” Alicia, a seasoned professional dancer, asked me in her distinctly Argentine\nSpanish.\n“Fantastic. Awesome. Let’s just enjoy the music. Forget the crowd—they’re not even here.”\nThat wasn’t entirely true. It was hard to even fathom 50,000 spectators and coordinators in La Rural,\neven if it was the biggest exhibition hall in Buenos Aires. Through the thick haze of cigarette smoke, you\ncould barely make out the huge undulating mass in the stands, and everywhere there was exposed floor,\nexcept the sacred 30′ x 40′ space in the middle of it all. I adjusted my pin-striped suit and fussed with my\nblue silk handkerchief until it was obvious that I was just fidgeting.\n“Are you nervous?”\n“I’m not nervous. I’m excited. I’m just going to have fun and let the rest follow.”\n“Number 152, you’re up.” Our chaperone had done his job, and now it was our turn. I whispered an\ninside joke to Alicia as we stepped on the hardwood platform: “Tranquilo”—Take it easy. She laughed,\nand at just that moment, I thought to myself, “What on earth would I be doing right now, if I hadn’t left\nmy job and the U.S. over a year ago?”\nThe thought vanished as quickly as it had appeared when the announcer came over the loudspeaker\nand the crowd erupted to match him: “Pareja numero 152, Timothy Ferriss y Alicia Monti, Ciudad de\nBuenos Aires!!!”\nWe were on, and I was beaming.\nTHE MOST FUNDAMENTAL of American questions is hard for me to answer these days, and luckily so. If\nit weren’t, you wouldn’t be holding this book in your hands.\n“So, what do you do?”\nAssuming you can find me (hard to do), and depending on when you ask me (I’d prefer you didn’t), I\ncould be racing motorcycles in Europe, scuba diving off a private island in Panama, resting under a palm\ntree between kickboxing sessions in Thailand, or dancing tango in Buenos Aires. The beauty is, I’m not a\nmultimillionaire, nor do I particularly care to be.\nI never enjoyed answering this cocktail question because it reflects an epidemic I was long part of: job\ndescriptions as self-descriptions. If someone asks me now and is anything but absolutely sincere, I\nexplain my lifestyle of mysterious means simply.\n“I’m a drug dealer.”\nPretty much a conversation ender. It’s only half true, besides. The whole truth would take too long.\nHow can I possibly explain that what I do with my time and what I do for money are completely\ndifferent things? That I work less than four hours per week and make more per month than I used to\nmake in a year?\nFor the first time, I’m going to tell you the real story. It involves a quiet subculture of people called\nthe “New Rich.”\nWhat does an igloo-dwelling millionaire do that a cubicle-dweller doesn’t? Follow an uncommon set\nof rules.\nHow does a lifelong blue-chip employee escape to travel the world for a month without his boss even\nnoticing? He uses technology to hide the fact.\nGold is getting old. The New Rich (NR) are those who abandon the deferred-life plan and create\nluxury lifestyles in the present using the currency of the New Rich: time and mobility. This is an art and\na science we will refer to as Lifestyle Design (LD).\nI’ve spent the last three years traveling among those who live in worlds currently beyond your\nimagination. Rather than hating reality, I’ll show you how to bend it to your will. It’s easier than it\nsounds. My journey from grossly overworked and severely underpaid office worker to member of the\nNR is at once stranger than fiction and—now that I’ve deciphered the code—simple to duplicate. There\nis a recipe.\nLife doesn’t have to be so damn hard. It really doesn’t. Most people, my past self included, have spent\ntoo much time convincing themselves that life has to be hard, a resignation to 9-to-5 drudgery in\nexchange for (sometimes) relaxing weekends and the occasional keep-it-short-or-get-fired vacation.\nThe truth, at least the truth I live and will share in this book, is quite different. From leveraging\ncurrency differences to outsourcing your life and disappearing, I’ll show you how a small underground\nuses economic sleight-of-hand to do what most consider impossible.\nIf you’ve picked up this book, chances are that you don’t want to sit behind a desk until you are 62.\nWhether your dream is escaping the rat race, real-life fantasy travel, long-term wandering, setting world\nrecords, or simply a dramatic career change, this book will give you all the tools you need to make it a\nreality in the here-and-now instead of in the often elusive “retirement.” There is a way to get the rewards\nfor a life of hard work without waiting until the end.\nHow? It begins with a simple distinction most people miss—one I missed for 25 years.\nPeople don’t want to be millionaires—they want to experience what they believe only millions can\nbuy. Ski chalets, butlers, and exotic travel often enter the picture. Perhaps rubbing cocoa butter on your\nbelly in a hammock while you listen to waves rhythmically lapping against the deck of your thatchedroof\nbungalow? Sounds nice.\n$1,000,000 in the bank isn’t the fantasy. The fantasy is the lifestyle of complete freedom it supposedly\nallows. The question is then, How can one achieve the millionaire lifestyle of complete freedom without\nfirst having $1,000,000?\nIn the last five years, I have answered this question for myself, and this book will answer it for you. I\nwill show you exactly how I have separated income from time and created my ideal lifestyle in the\nprocess, traveling the world and enjoying the best this planet has to offer. How on earth did I go from\n14-hour days and $40,000 per year to 4-hour weeks and $40,000-plus per month?\nIt helps to know where it all started. Strangely enough, it was in a class of soon-to-be investment\nbankers.\nIn 2002, I was asked by Ed Zschau, übermentor and my former professor of High-tech\nEntrepreneurship at Princeton University, to come back and speak to the same class about my business\nadventures in the real world. I was stuck. There were already decamillionaires speaking to the same\nclass, and even though I had built a highly profitable sports supplement company, I marched to a\ndistinctly different drummer.\nOver the ensuing days, however, I realized that everyone seemed to be discussing how to build large\nand successful companies, sell out, and live the good life. Fair enough. The question no one really\nseemed to be asking or answering was, Why do it all in the first place? What is the pot of gold that\njustifies spending the best years of your life hoping for happiness in the last?\nThe lectures I ultimately developed, titled “Drug Dealing for Fun and Profit,” began with a simple\npremise: Test the most basic assumptions of the work-life equation.\nHow do your decisions change if retirement isn’t an option?\nWhat if you could use a mini-retirement to sample your deferredlife\nplan reward before working 40 years for it?\nIs it really necessary to work like a slave to live like a millionaire?\nLittle did I know where questions like these would take me.\nThe uncommon conclusion? The commonsense rules of the “real world” are a fragile collection of\nsocially reinforced illusions. This book will teach you how to see and seize the options others do not.\nWhat makes this book different?\nFirst, I’m not going to spend much time on the problem. I’m going to assume you are suffering from\ntime famine, creeping dread, or—worst case—a tolerable and comfortable existence doing something\nunfulfilling. The last is most common and most insidious.\nSecond, this book is not about saving and will not recommend you abandon your daily glass of red\nwine for a million dollars 50 years from now. I’d rather have the wine. I won’t ask you to choose\nbetween enjoyment today or money later. I believe you can have both now. The goal is fun and profit.\nThird, this book is not about finding your “dream job.” I will take as a given that, for most people,\nsomewhere between six and seven billion of them, the perfect job is the one that takes the least time. The\nvast majority of people will never find a job that can be an unending source of fulfillment, so that is not\nthe goal here; to free time and automate income is.\nI OPEN EACH class with an explanation of the singular importance of being a “dealmaker.” The manifesto\nof the dealmaker is simple: Reality is negotiable. Outside of science and law, all rules can be bent or\nbroken, and it doesn’t require being unethical.\nThe DEAL of deal making is also an acronym for the process of becoming a member of the New\nRich.\nThe steps and strategies can be used with incredible results—whether you are an employee or an\nentrepreneur. Can you do everything I’ve done with a boss? No. Can you use the same principles to\ndouble your income, cut your hours in half, or at least double the usual vacation time? Most definitely.\nHere is the step-by-step process you’ll use to reinvent yourself:\nD for Definition turns misguided common sense upside down and introduces the rules and objectives of\nthe new game. It replaces self-defeating assumptions and explains concepts such as relative wealth and\neustress. 1 Who are the NR and how do they operate? This section explains the overall lifestyle design\nrecipe—the fundamentals—before we add the three ingredients.\nE for Elimination kills the obsolete notion of time management once and for all. It shows exactly how I\nused the words of an often-forgotten Italian economist to turn 12-hour days into two-hour days … in 48\nhours. Increase your per-hour results ten times or more with counterintuitive NR techniques for\ncultivating selective ignorance, developing a low-information diet, and otherwise ignoring the\nunimportant. This section provides the first of the three luxury lifestyle design ingredients: time.\nA for Automation puts cash flow on autopilot using geographic arbitrage, outsourcing, and rules of\nnondecision. From bracketing to the routines of ultrasuccessful NR, it’s all here. This section provides\nthe second ingredient of luxury lifestyle design: income.\nL for Liberation is the mobile manifesto for the globally inclined. The concept of mini-retirements is\nintroduced, as are the means for flawless remote control and escaping the boss. Liberation is not about\ncheap travel; it is about forever breaking the bonds that confine you to a single location. This section\ndelivers the third and final ingredient for luxury lifestyle design: mobility.\nI should note that most bosses are less than pleased if you spend one hour in the office each day, and\nemployees should therefore read the steps in the entrepreneurially minded DEAL order but implement\nthem as DELA. If you decide to remain in your current job, it is necessary to create freedom of location\nbefore you cut your work hours by 80%. Even if you have never considered becoming an entrepreneur in\nthe modern sense, the DEAL process will turn you into an entrepreneur in the purer sense as first coined\nby French economist J. B. Say in 1800—one who shifts economic resources out of an area of lower and\ninto an area of higher yield.\nLast but not least, much of what I recommend will seem impossible and even offensive to basic\ncommon sense—I expect that. Resolve now to test the concepts as an exercise in lateral thinking. If you\ntry it, you’ll see just how deep the rabbit hole goes, and you won’t ever go back.\nTake a deep breath and let me show you my world. And remember—tranquilo. It’s time to have fun\nand let the rest follow.\nTIM FERRISS\nTokyo, Japan\nSeptember 29, 2006\n1. Uncommon terms are defined throughout this book as concepts are introduced.

I survive instead and grow so fat that\nI can’t roll onto my stomach. A muscular imbalance of the eyes makes me look in opposite directions,\nand my mother refers to me affectionately as “tuna fish.” So far so good.\n1983 Nearly fail kindergarten because I refuse to learn the alphabet. My teacher refuses to explain\nwhy I should learn it, opting instead for “I’m the teacher—that’s why.” I tell her that’s stupid and ask her\nto leave me alone so I can focus on drawing sharks. She sends me to the “bad table” instead and makes\nme eat a bar of soap. Disdain for authority begins.\n1991 My first job. Ah, the memories. I’m hired for minimum wage as the cleaner at an ice cream\nparlor and quickly realize that the big boss’s methods duplicate effort. I do it my way, finish in one hour\ninstead of eight, and spend the rest of the time reading kung-fu magazines and practicing karate kicks\noutside. I am fired in a record three days, left with the parting comment, “Maybe someday you’ll\nunderstand the value of hard work.” It seems I still don’t.\n1993 I volunteer for a one-year exchange program in Japan, where people work themselves to death—\na phenomenon called karooshi—and are said to want to be Shinto when born, Christian when married,\nand Buddhist when they die. I conclude that most people are really confused about life. One evening,\nintending to ask my host mother to wake me the next morning (okosu), I ask her to violently rape me\n(okasu). She is very confused.\n1996 I manage to slip undetected into Princeton, despite SAT scores 40% lower than the average and\nmy high school admissions counselor telling me to be more “realistic.” I conclude I’m just not good at\nreality. I major in neuroscience and then switch to East Asian studies to avoid putting printer jacks on cat\nheads.\n1997 Millionaire time! I create an audiobook called How I Beat the Ivy League, use all my money\nfrom three summer jobs to manufacture 500 tapes, and proceed to sell exactly none. I will allow my\nmother to throw them out only in 2006, just nine years of denial later. Such is the joy of baseless\noverconfidence.\n1998 After four shot-putters kick a friend’s head in, I quit bouncing, the highest-paying job on\ncampus, and develop a speed-reading seminar. I plaster campus with hundreds of god-awful neon green\nflyers that read, “triple your reading speed in 3 hours!” and prototypical Princeton students proceed to\nwrite “bullsh*t” on every single one. I sell 32 spots at $50 each for the 3-hour event, and $533 per hour\nconvinces me that finding a market before designing a product is smarter than the reverse. Two months\nlater, I’m bored to tears of speed-reading and close up shop. I hate services and need a product to ship.\nFall 1998 A huge thesis dispute and the acute fear of becoming an investment banker drive me to\ncommit academic suicide and inform the registrar that I am quitting school until further notice. My dad is\nconvinced that I’ll never go back, and I’m convinced that my life is over. My mom thinks it’s no big deal\nand that there is no need to be a drama queen.\nSpring 1999 In three months, I accept and quit jobs as a curriculum designer at Berlitz, the world’s\nlargest publisher of foreign-language materials, and as an analyst at a three-person political asylum\nresearch firm. Naturally, I then fly to Taiwan to create a gym chain out of thin air and get shut down by\nTriads, Chinese mafia. I return to the U.S. defeated and decide to learn kickboxing, winning the national\nchampionship four weeks later with the ugliest and most unorthodox style ever witnessed.\nFall 2000 Confidence restored and thesis completely undone, I return to Princeton. My life does not\nend, and it seems the yearlong delay has worked out in my favor. Twenty-somethings now have David\nKoresh–like abilities. My friend sells a company for $450 million, and I decide to head west to sunny\nCalifornia to make my billions. Despite the hottest job market in the history of the world, I manage to go\njobless until three months after graduation, when I pull out my trump card and send one start-up CEO 32\nconsecutive e-mails. He finally gives in and puts me in sales.\nSpring 2001 TrueSAN Networks has gone from a 15-person nobody to the “number one privately\nheld data storage company” (how is that measured?) with 150 employees (what are they all doing?). I am\nordered by a newly appointed sales director to “start with A” in the phone book and dial for dollars. I ask\nhim in the most tactful way possible why we are doing it like retards. He says, “Because I say so.” Not a\ngood start.\nFall 2001 After a year of 12-hour days, I find out that I’m the second-lowest-paid person in the\ncompany aside from the receptionist. I resort to aggressively surfing the web full-time. One afternoon,\nhaving run out of obscene video clips to forward, I investigate how hard it would be to start a sports\nnutrition company. Turns out that you can outsource everything from manufacturing to ad design. Two\nweeks and $5,000 of credit card debt later, I have my first batch in production and a live website. Good\nthing, too, as I’m fired exactly one week later.\n2002–2003 BrainQUICKEN LLC has taken off, and I’m now making more than $40K per month\ninstead of $40K per year. The only problem is that I hate life and now work 12-hour-plus days 7 days a\nweek. Kinda painted myself into a corner. I take a one-week “vacation” to Florence, Italy, with my\nfamily and spend 10 hours a day in an Internet café freaking out. Sh*t balls. I begin teaching Princeton\nstudents how to build “successful” (i.e., profitable) companies.\nWinter 2004 The impossible happens and I’m approached by an infomercial production company and\nan Israeli conglomerate (huh?) interested in buying my baby BrainQUICKEN. I simplify, eliminate, and\notherwise clean house to make myself expendable. Miraculously, BQ doesn’t fall apart, but both deals\ndo. Back to Groundhog Day. Soon thereafter, both companies attempt to replicate my product and lose\nmillions of dollars.\nJune 2004 I decide that, even if my company implodes, I need to escape before I go Howard Hughes. I\nturn everything upside down and—backpack in hand—go to JFK Airport in New York City, buying the\nfirst one-way ticket to Europe I can find. I land in London and intend to continue on to Spain for four\nweeks of recharging my batteries before returning to the salt mines. I start my relaxation by promptly\nhaving a nervous breakdown the first morning.\nJuly 2004–2005 Four weeks turn into eight, and I decide to stay overseas indefinitely for a final exam\nin automation and experimental living, limiting e-mail to one hour each Monday morning. As soon as I\nremove myself as a bottleneck, profits increase 40%. What on earth do you do when you no longer have\nwork as an excuse to be hyperactive and avoid the big questions? Be terrified and hold on to your ass\nwith both hands, apparently.\nSeptember 2006 I return to the U.S. in an odd, Zen-like state after methodically destroying all of my\nassumptions about what can and cannot be done. “Drug Dealing for Fun and Profit” has evolved into a\nclass on ideal lifestyle design. The new message is simple: I’ve seen the promised land, and there is good\nnews. You can have it all.\nStep I:\nD is for Definition\nReality is merely an illusion,\nalbeit a very persistent one .\n— ALBERT EINSTEIN\nCautions and Comparisons\nHOW TO BURN $1,000,000 A NIGHT\nThese individuals have riches just as we say that we “have a fever,” when really the fever has\nus.\n— SENECA (4 B.C.–A.D. 65)\nI also have in mind that seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who\nhave accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it, and thus have forged their\nown golden or silver fetters.\n— HENRY DAVID THOREAU (1817–1862)\n1:00 A.M. CST / 30,000 FEET OVER LAS VEGAS\nHis friends, drunk to the point of speaking in tongues, were asleep. It was just the two of us now in\nfirst-class. He extended his hand to introduce himself, and an enormous—Looney Tunes enormous—\ndiamond ring appeared from the ether as his fingers crossed under my reading light.\nMark was a legitimate magnate. He had, at different times, run practically all the gas stations,\nconvenience stores, and gambling in South Carolina. He confessed with a half smile that, in an average\ntrip to Sin City, he and his fellow weekend warriors might lose an average of $500,000 to $1,000,000—\neach. Nice.\nHe sat up in his seat as the conversation drifted to my travels, but I was more interested in his\nastounding record of printing money.\n“So, of all your businesses, which did you like the most?”\nThe answer took less than a second of thought.\n“None of them.”\nHe explained that he had spent more than 30 years with people he didn’t like to buy things he didn’t\nneed. Life had become a succession of trophy wives—he was on lucky number three—expensive cars,\nand other empty bragging rights. Mark was one of the living dead.\nThis is exactly where we don’t want to end up.\nApples and Oranges: A Comparison\nSo, what makes the difference? What separates the New Rich, characterized by options, from the\nDeferrers (D), those who save it all for the end only to find that life has passed them by?\nIt begins at the beginning. The New Rich can be separated from the crowd based on their goals, which\nreflect very distinct priorities and life philosophies.\nNote how subtle differences in wording completely change the necessary actions for fulfilling what at\na glance appear to be similar goals. These are not limited to business owners. Even the first, as I will\nshow later, applies to employees.\nD: To work for yourself.\nNR: To have others work for you.\nD: To work when you want to.\nNR: To prevent work for work’s sake, and to do the minimum necessary for maximum effect (“minimum\neffective load”).\nD: To retire early or young.\nNR: To distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life on a regular basis\nand recognize that inactivity is not the goal. Doing that which excites you is.\nD: To buy all the things you want to have.\nNR: To do all the things you want to do, and be all the things you want to be. If this includes some tools\nand gadgets, so be it, but they are either means to an end or bonuses, not the focus.\nD: To be the boss instead of the employee; to be in charge.\nNR: To be neither the boss nor the employee, but the owner. To own the trains and have someone else\nensure they run on time.\nD: To make a ton of money.\nNR: To make a ton of money with specific reasons and defined dreams to chase, timelines and steps\nincluded. What are you working for?\nD: To have more.\nNR: To have more quality and less clutter. To have huge financial reserves but recognize that most\nmaterial wants are justifications for spending time on the things that don’t really matter, including\nbuying things and preparing to buy things. You spent two weeks negotiating your new Infiniti with the\ndealership and got $10,000 off? That’s great. Does your life have a purpose? Are you contributing\nanything useful to this world, or just shuffling papers, banging on a keyboard, and coming home to a\ndrunken existence on the weekends?\nD: To reach the big pay-off, whether IPO, acquisition, retirement, or other pot of gold.\nNR: To think big but ensure payday comes every day: cash flow first, big payday second.\nD: To have freedom from doing that which you dislike.\nNR: To have freedom from doing that which you dislike, but also the freedom and resolve to pursue your\ndreams without reverting to work for work’s sake (W4W). After years of repetitive work, you will\noften need to dig hard to find your passions, redefine your dreams, and revive hobbies that you let\natrophy to near extinction. The goal is not to simply eliminate the bad, which does nothing more than\nleave you with a vacuum, but to pursue and experience the best in the world.\nGetting Off the Wrong Train\nThe first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.\n—RICHARD P. FEYNMAN, Nobel Prize–winning physicist\nEnough is enough. Lemmings no more. The blind quest for cash is a fool’s errand.\nI’ve chartered private planes over the Andes, enjoyed many of the best wines in the world in between\nworld-class ski runs, and lived like a king, lounging by the infinity pool of a private villa. Here’s the\nlittle secret I rarely tell: It all cost less than rent in the U.S. If you can free your time and location, your\nmoney is automatically worth 3–10 times as much.\nThis has nothing to do with currency rates. Being financially rich and having the ability to live like a\nmillionaire are fundamentally two very different things.\nMoney is multiplied in practical value depending on the number of W’s you control in your life: what\nyou do, when you do it, where you do it, and with whom you do it. I call this the “freedom multiplier.”\nUsing this as our criterion, the 80-hour-per-week, $500,000-per-year investment banker is less\n“powerful” than the employed NR who works ¼ the hours for $40,000, but has complete freedom of\nwhen, where, and how to live. The former’s $500,000 may be worth less than $40,000 and the latter’s\n$40,000 worth more than $500,000 when we run the numbers and look at the lifestyle output of their\nmoney.\nOptions—the ability to choose—is real power. This book is all about how to see and create those\noptions with the least effort and cost. It just so happens, paradoxically, that you can make more money—\na lot more money—by doing half of what you are doing now.\nSo, Who Are the NR?\nThe employee who rearranges his schedule and negotiates a\nremote work agreement to achieve 90% of the results in one-tenth\nof the time, which frees him to practice cross-country skiing and\ntake road trips with his family two weeks per month.\nThe business owner who eliminates the least profitable customers\nand projects, outsources all operations entirely, and travels the\nworld collecting rare documents, all while working remotely on a\nwebsite to showcase her own illustration work.\nThe student who elects to risk it all—which is nothing—to\nestablish an online video rental service that delivers $5,000 per\nmonth in income from a small niche of Blu-ray aficionados, a\ntwo-hour-per-week side project that allows him to work full-time\nas an animal rights lobbyist.\nThe options are limitless, but each path begins with the same first step: replacing assumptions.\nTo join the movement, you will need to learn a new lexicon and recalibrate direction using a compass\nfor an unusual world. From inverting responsibility to jettisoning the entire concept of “success,” we\nneed to change the rules.\nNew Players for a New Game:\nGlobal and Unrestricted\nTURIN, ITALY\nCivilization had too many rules for me, so I did my best to rewrite them.\n—BILL COSBY\nAs he rotated 360 degrees through the air, the deafening noise turned to silence. Dale Begg-Smith\nexecuted the backflip perfectly—skis crossed in an X over his head—and landed in the record books as\nhe slid across the finish.\nIt was February 16, 2006, and he was now a mogul-skiing gold medalist at the Turin Winter\nOlympics. Unlike other full-time athletes, he will never have to return to a dead-end job after his\nmoment of glory, nor will he look back at this day as the climax of his only passion. After all, he was\nonly 21 years old and drove a black Lamborghini.\nBorn a Canadian and something of a late bloomer, Dale found his calling, an Internet-based IT\ncompany, at the age of 13. Fortunately, he had a more-experienced mentor and partner to guide him: his\n15-year-old brother, Jason. Created to fund their dreams of standing atop the Olympic podium, it would,\nonly two years later, become the third-largest company of its kind in the world.\nWhile Dale’s teammates were hitting the slopes for extra sessions, he was often buying sake for clients\nin Tokyo. In a world of “work harder, not smarter,” it came to pass that his coaches felt he was spending\ntoo much time on his business and not enough time in training, despite his results.\nRather than choose between his business or his dream, Dale chose to move laterally with both, from\neither/or to both/and. He wasn’t spending too much time on his business; he and his brother were\nspending too much time with Canucks.\nIn 2002, they moved to the ski capital of the world, Australia, where the team was smaller, more\nflexible, and coached by a legend. Three short years later, he received citizenship, went head-to-head\nagainst former teammates, and became the third “Aussie” in history to win winter gold.\nIn the land of wallabies and big surf, Dale has since gone postal. Literally. Right next to the Elvis\nPresley commemorative edition, you can buy stamps with his face on them.\nFame has its perks, as does looking outside the choices presented to you. There are always lateral\noptions.\nNEW CALEDOINA, SOUTH PACIFIC OCEAN\nOnce you say you’re going to settle for second, that’s what happens to you in life.\n—JOHN F. KENNEDY\nSome people remain convinced that just a bit more money will make things right. Their goals are\narbitrary moving targets: $300,000 in the bank, $1,000,000 in the portfolio, $100,000 a year instead of\n$50,000, etc. Julie’s goal made intrinsic sense: come back with the same number of children she had left\nwith.\nShe reclined in her seat and glanced across the aisle past her sleeping husband, Marc, counting as she\nhad done thousands of times—one, two, three. So far so good. In 12 hours, they would all be back in\nParis, safe and sound. That was assuming the plane from New Caledonia held together, of course.\nNew Caledonia?\nNestled in the tropics of the Coral Sea, New Caledonia was a French territory and where Julie and\nMarc had just sold the sailboat that took them 15,000 miles around the world. Of course, recouping their\ninitial investment had been part of the plan. All said and done, their 15-month exploration of the globe,\nfrom the gondola-rich waterways of Venice to the tribal shores of Polynesia, had cost between $18,000\nand $19,000. Less than rent and baguettes in Paris.\nMost people would consider this impossible. Then again, most people don’t know that more than 300\nfamilies set sail from France each year to do the same.\nThe trip had been a dream for almost two decades, relegated to the back of the line behind an evergrowing\nlist of responsibilities. Each passing moment brought a new list of reasons for putting it off. One\nday, Julie realized that if she didn’t do it now, she would never do it. The rationalizations, legitimate or\nnot, would just continue to add up and make it harder to convince herself that escape was possible.\nOne year of preparation and one 30-day trial run with her husband later, they set sail on the trip of a\nlifetime. Julie realized almost as soon as the anchor lifted that, far from being a reason not to travel and\nseek adventure, children are perhaps the best reason of all to do both.\nPre-trip, her three little boys had fought like banshees at the drop of a hat. In the process of learning to\ncoexist in a floating bedroom, they learned patience, as much for themselves as for the sanity of their\nparents. Pre-trip, books were about as appealing as eating sand. Given the alternative of staring at a wall\non the open sea, all three learned to love books. Pulling them out of school for one academic year and\nexposing them to new environments had proven to be the best investment in their education to date.\nNow sitting in the plane, Julie looked out at the clouds as the wing cut past them, already thinking of\ntheir next plans: to find a place in the mountains and ski all year long, using income from a sail-rigging\nworkshop to fund the slopes and more travel.\nNow that she had done it once, she had the itch.\nLIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION\nI was done with driving across town to collect my son from child- care only to slide across icy\nhighways trying to get back to work with him in tow to finish my work. My mini-retirement brought us\nboth to live at an alternative boarding school full of creative lifestyle redesigning children and staff in a\ngorgeous Florida forest with a spring-fed pond and plenty of sunshine. You can easily search for\nalternative schools or traditional schools that might accept your children during your stay. Alternative\nschools often see themselves as supportive communities and are exceptionally welcoming. You might\neven find an opportunity to work at a school where you could experience a new environment with your\nchild.\n—DEB\nTim,\nYour book and blog have inspired me to quit my job, write two e-books, sky dive, backpack through\nSouth America, sell all the clutter in my life, and host an annual convention of the world’s top dating\ninstructors (my primary business venture, third year running). The best part? I can’t even buy a drink yet.\nThank you so much, bro!\n—ANTHONY\nRules That Change the Rules\nEVERYTHING POPULAR IS WRONG\nI can’t give you a surefire formula for success, but I can give you a formula for failure: try to\nplease everybody all the time.\n—HERBERT BAYARD SWOPE, American editor and journalist; first recipient of the Pulitzer Prize\nEverything popular is wrong.\n—OSCAR WILDE, The Importance of Being Earnest\nBeating the Game, Not Playing the Game\nIn 1999, sometime after quitting my second unfulfilling job and eating peanut-butter sandwiches for\ncomfort, I won the gold medal at the Chinese Kickboxing (Sanshou) National Championships.\nIt wasn’t because I was good at punching and kicking. God forbid. That seemed a bit dangerous,\nconsidering I did it on a dare and had four weeks of preparation. Besides, I have a watermelon head—it’s\na big target.\nI won by reading the rules and looking for unexploited opportunities, of which there were two:\n1. Weigh-ins were the day prior to competition: Using dehydration techniques commonly practiced by\nelite powerlifters and Olympic wrestlers, I lost 28 pounds in 18 hours, weighed in at 165 pounds, and\nthen hyperhydrated back to 193 pounds. 2 It’s hard to fight someone from three weight classes above you.\nPoor little guys.\n2. There was a technicality in the fine print: If one combatant fell off the elevated platform three times\nin a single round, his opponent won by default. I decided to use this technicality as my principal\ntechnique and push people off. As you might imagine, this did not make the judges the happiest Chinese\nI’ve ever seen.\nThe result? I won all of my matches by technical knock-out (TKO) and went home national champion,\nsomething 99% of those with 5–10 years of experience had been unable to do.\nBut, isn’t pushing people out of the ring pushing the boundaries of ethics? Not at all—it’s no more\nthan doing the uncommon within the rules. The important distinction is that between official rules and\nself-imposed rules. Consider the following example, from the official website of the Olympic movement\n(www.olympic.org).\nThe 1968 Mexico City Olympics marked the international debut of Dick Fosbury and his celebrated\n“Fosbury flop,” which would soon revolutionize high-jumping. At the time, jumpers… swung their\noutside foot up and over the bar [called the “straddle,” much like a hurdle jump, it allowed you to land on\nyour feet]. Fosbury’s technique began by racing up to the bar at great speed and taking off from his right\n(or outside) foot. Then he twisted his body so that he went over the bar head-first with his back to the\nbar. While the coaches of the world shook their heads in disbelief, the Mexico City audience was\nabsolutely captivated by Fosbury and shouted, “Olé!” as he cleared the bar. Fosbury cleared every height\nthrough 2.22 metres without a miss and then achieved a personal record of 2.24 metres to win the gold\nmedal.\nBy 1980, 13 of the 16 Olympic finalists were using the Fosbury flop.\nThe weight-cutting techniques and off-platform throwing I used are now standard features of Sanshou\ncompetition. I didn’t cause it, I just foresaw it as inevitable, as did others who tested this superior\napproach. Now it’s par for the course.\nSports evolve when sacred cows are killed, when basic assumptions are tested.\nThe same is true in life and in lifestyles.\nChallenging the Status Quo vs. Being Stupid\nMost people walk down the street on their legs. Does that mean I walk down the street on my hands?\nDo I wear my underwear outside of my pants in the name of being different? Not usually, no. Then\nagain, walking on my legs and keeping my thong on the inside have worked just fine thus far. I don’t fix\nit if it isn’t broken.\nDifferent is better when it is more effective or more fun.\nIf everyone is defining a problem or solving it one way and the results are subpar, this is the time to\nask, What if I did the opposite? Don’t follow a model that doesn’t work. If the recipe sucks, it doesn’t\nmatter how good a cook you are.\nWhen I was in data storage sales, my first gig out of college, I realized that most cold calls didn’t get\nto the intended person for one reason: gatekeepers. If I simply made all my calls from 8:00–8:30 A.M.\nand 6:00–6:30 P.M., for a total of one hour, I was able to avoid secretaries and book more than twice as\nmany meetings as the senior sales executives who called from 9–5. In other words, I got twice the results\nfor 1/8 the time.\nFrom Japan to Monaco, from globetrotting single mothers to multimillionaire racecar drivers, the basic\nrules of successful NR are surprisingly uniform and predictably divergent from what the rest of the\nworld is doing.\nThe following rules are the fundamental differentiators to keep in mind throughout this book.\n1. Retirement Is Worst-Case-Scenario Insurance.\nRetirement planning is like life insurance. It should be viewed as nothing more than a hedge against the\nabsolute worst-case scenario: in this case, becoming physically incapable of working and needing a\nreservoir of capital to survive.\nRetirement as a goal or final redemption is flawed for at least three solid reasons:\n1. It is predicated on the assumption that you dislike what you are doing during the most physically\ncapable years of your life. This is a nonstarter—nothing can justify that sacrifice.\n2. Most people will never be able to retire and maintain even a hotdogs-for-dinner standard of living.\nEven one million is chump change in a world where traditional retirement could span 30 years and\ninflation lowers your purchasing power 2–4% per year. The math doesn’t work. 3 The golden years\nbecome lower-middle-class life revisited. That’s a bittersweet ending.\n3. If the math does work, it means that you are one ambitious, hardworking machine. If that’s the\ncase, guess what? One week into retirement, you’ll be so damn bored that you’ll want to stick\nbicycle spokes in your eyes. You’ll probably opt to look for a new job or start another company.\nKinda defeats the purpose of waiting, doesn’t it?\nI’m not saying don’t plan for the worst case—I have maxed out 401(k)s and IRAs I use primarily for\ntax purposes—but don’t mistake retirement for the goal.\n2. Interest and Energy Are Cyclical.\nIf I offered you $10,000,000 to work 24 hours a day for 15 years and then retire, would you do it? Of\ncourse not—you couldn’t. It is unsustainable, just as what most define as a career: doing the same thing\nfor 8+ hours per day until you break down or have enough cash to permanently stop.\nHow else can my 30-year-old friends all look like a cross between Donald Trump and Joan Rivers?\nIt’s horrendous—premature aging fueled by triple bypass frappuccinos and impossible workloads.\nAlternating periods of activity and rest is necessary to survive, let alone thrive. Capacity, interest, and\nmental endurance all wax and wane. Plan accordingly.\nThe NR aims to distribute “mini-retirements” throughout life instead of hoarding the recovery and\nenjoyment for the fool’s gold of retirement. By working only when you are most effective, life is both\nmore productive and more enjoyable. It’s the perfect example of having your cake and eating it, too.\nPersonally, I now aim for one month of overseas relocation or high-intensity learning (tango, fighting,\nwhatever) for every two months of work projects.\n3. Less Is Not Laziness.\nDoing less meaningless work, so that you can focus on things of greater personal importance, is NOT\nlaziness. This is hard for most to accept, because our culture tends to reward personal sacrifice instead of\npersonal productivity.\nFew people choose to (or are able to) measure the results of their actions and thus measure their\ncontribution in time. More time equals more self-worth and more reinforcement from those above and\naround them. The NR, despite fewer hours in the office, produce more meaningful results than the next\ndozen non-NR combined.\nLet’s define “laziness” anew—to endure a non-ideal existence, to let circumstance or others decide life\nfor you, or to amass a fortune while passing through life like a spectator from an office window. The size\nof your bank account doesn’t change this, nor does the number of hours you log in handling unimportant\ne-mail or minutiae.\nFocus on being productive instead of busy.\n4. The Timing Is Never Right.\nI once asked my mom how she decided when to have her first child, little ol’ me. The answer was\nsimple: “It was something we wanted, and we decided there was no point in putting it off. The timing is\nnever right to have a baby.” And so it is.\nFor all of the most important things, the timing always sucks. Waiting for a good time to quit your\njob? The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The\nuniverse doesn’t conspire against you, but it doesn’t go out of its way to line up all the pins either.\nConditions are never perfect. “Someday” is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you.\nPro and con lists are just as bad. If it’s important to you and you want to do it “eventually,” just do it and\ncorrect course along the way.\n5. Ask for Forgiveness, Not Permission.\nIf it isn’t going to devastate those around you, try it and then justify it. People—whether parents,\npartners, or bosses—deny things on an emotional basis that they can learn to accept after the fact. If the\npotential damage is moderate or in any way reversible, don’t give people the chance to say no. Most\npeople are fast to stop you before you get started but hesitant to get in the way if you’re moving. Get\ngood at being a troublemaker and saying sorry when you really screw up.\n6. Emphasize Strengths, Don’t Fix Weaknesses.\nMost people are good at a handful of things and utterly miserable at most. I am great at product creation\nand marketing but terrible at most of the things that follow.\nMy body is designed to lift heavy objects and throw them, and that’s it. I ignored this for a long time.\nI tried swimming and looked like a drowning monkey. I tried basketball and looked like a caveman.\nThen I became a fighter and took off.\nIt is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths instead of attempting to fix all the chinks in\nyour armor. The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvement\nfixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre. Focus on better use of your best weapons instead\nof constant repair.\n7. Things in Excess Become Their Opposite.\nIt is possible to have too much of a good thing. In excess, most endeavors and possessions take on the\ncharacteristics of their opposite. Thus:\nPacifists become militants.\nFreedom fighters become tyrants.\nBlessings become curses.\nHelp becomes hindrance. More becomes less. 4\nToo much, too many, and too often of what you want becomes what you don’t want. This is true of\npossessions and even time. Lifestyle Design is thus not interested in creating an excess of idle time,\nwhich is poisonous, but the positive use of free time, defined simply as doing what you want as opposed\nto what you feel obligated to do.\n8. Money Alone Is Not the Solution.\nThere is much to be said for the power of money as currency (I’m a fan myself), but adding more of it\njust isn’t the answer as often as we’d like to think. In part, it’s laziness. “If only I had more money” is\nthe easiest way to postpone the intense self-examination and decision-making necessary to create a life\nof enjoyment—now and not later. By using money as the scapegoat and work as our all-consuming\nroutine, we are able to conveniently disallow ourselves the time to do otherwise: “John, I’d love to talk\nabout the gaping void I feel in my life, the hopelessness that hits me like a punch in the eye every time I\nstart my computer in the morning, but I have so much work to do! I’ve got at least three hours of\nunimportant e-mail to reply to before calling the prospects who said ‘no’ yesterday. Gotta run!”\nBusy yourself with the routine of the money wheel, pretend it’s the fix-all, and you artfully create a\nconstant distraction that prevents you from seeing just how pointless it is. Deep down, you know it’s all\nan illusion, but with everyone participating in the same game of make-believe, it’s easy to forget.\nThe problem is more than money.\n9. Relative Income Is More Important Than Absolute Income.\nAmong dietitians and nutritionists, there is some debate over the value of a calorie. Is a calorie a calorie,\nmuch like a rose is a rose? Is fat loss as simple as expending more calories than you consume, or is the\nsource of those calories important? Based on work with top athletes, I know the answer to be the latter.\nWhat about income? Is a dollar is a dollar is a dollar? The New Rich don’t think so.\nLet’s look at this like a fifth-grade math problem. Two hardworking chaps are headed toward each\nother. Chap A moving at 80 hours per week and Chap B moving at 10 hours per week. They both make\n$50,000 per year. Who will be richer when they pass in the middle of the night? If you said B, you would\nbe correct, and this is the difference between absolute and relative income.\nAbsolute income is measured using one holy and inalterable variable: the raw and almighty dollar.\nJane Doe makes $100,000 per year and is thus twice as rich as John Doe, who makes $50,000 per year.\nRelative income uses two variables: the dollar and time, usually hours. The whole “per year” concept\nis arbitrary and makes it easy to trick yourself. Let’s look at the real trade. Jane Doe makes $100,000 per\nyear, $2,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, and works 80 hours per week. Jane Doe thus makes $25 per\nhour. John Doe makes $50,000 per year, $1,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, but works 10 hours per\nweek and hence makes $100 per hour. In relative income, John is four times richer.\nOf course, relative income has to add up to the minimum amount necessary to actualize your goals. If I\nmake $100 per hour but only work one hour per week, it’s going to be hard for me to run amuck like a\nsuperstar. Assuming that the total absolute income is where it needs to be to live my dreams (not an\narbitrary point of comparison with the Joneses), relative income is the real measurement of wealth for the\nNew Rich.\nThe top New Rich mavericks make at least $5,000 per hour. Out of college, I started at about $5. I’ll\nget you closer to the former.\n10. Distress Is Bad, Eustress Is Good.\nUnbeknownst to most fun-loving bipeds, not all stress is bad. Indeed, the New Rich don’t aim to\neliminate all stress. Not in the least. There are two separate types of stress, each as different as euphoria\nand its seldom-mentioned opposite, dysphoria.\nDistress refers to harmful stimuli that make you weaker, less confident, and less able. Destructive\ncriticism, abusive bosses, and smashing your face on a curb are examples of this. These are things we\nwant to avoid.\nEustress, on the other hand, is a word most of you have probably never heard. Eu-, a Greek prefix for\n“healthy,” is used in the same sense in the word “euphoria.” Role models who push us to exceed our\nlimits, physical training that removes our spare tires, and risks that expand our sphere of comfortable\naction are all examples of eustress—stress that is healthful and the stimulus for growth.\nPeople who avoid all criticism fail. It’s destructive criticism we need to avoid, not criticism in all\nforms. Similarly, there is no progress without eustress, and the more eustress we can create or apply to\nour lives, the sooner we can actualize our dreams. The trick is telling the two apart.\nThe New Rich are equally aggressive in removing distress and finding eustress.\nQ&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS\n1. How has being “realistic” or “responsible” kept you from the life you want?\n2. How has doing what you “should” resulted in subpar experiences or regret for not having done\nsomething else?\n3. Look at what you’re currently doing and ask yourself, “What would happen if I did the opposite of\nthe people around me? What will I sacrifice if I continue on this track for 5, 10, or 20 years?”\n2.

Ruuuuuuuuuun!” Hans didn’t speak Portuguese, but the meaning was clear enough—haul ass.\nHis sneakers gripped firmly on the jagged rock, and he drove his chest forward toward 3,000 feet of\nnothing.\nHe held his breath on the final step, and the panic drove him to near unconsciousness. His vision\nblurred at the edges, closing to a single pinpoint of light, and then … he floated. The all-consuming\ncelestial blue of the horizon hit his visual field an instant after he realized that the thermal updraft had\ncaught him and the wings of the paraglider. Fear was behind him on the mountaintop, and thousands of\nfeet above the resplendent green rain forest and pristine white beaches of Copacabana, Hans Keeling had\nseen the light.\nThat was Sunday.\nOn Monday, Hans returned to his law office in Century City, Los Angeles’s posh corporate haven, and\npromptly handed in his three-week notice. For nearly five years, he had faced his alarm clock with the\nsame dread: I have to do this for another 40–45 years? He had once slept under his desk at the office\nafter a punishing half-done project, only to wake up and continue on it the next morning. That same\nmorning, he had made himself a promise: two more times and I’m out of here. Strike number three came\nthe day before he left for his Brazilian vacation.\nWe all make these promises to ourselves, and Hans had done it before as well, but things were now\nsomehow different. He was different. He had realized something while arcing in slow circles toward the\nearth—risks weren’t that scary once you took them. His colleagues told him what he expected to hear: He\nwas throwing it all away. He was an attorney on his way to the top—what the hell did he want?\nHans didn’t know exactly what he wanted, but he had tasted it. On the other hand, he did know what\nbored him to tears, and he was done with it. No more passing days as the living dead, no more dinners\nwhere his colleagues compared cars, riding on the sugar high of a new BMW purchase until someone\nbought a more expensive Mercedes. It was over.\nImmediately, a strange shift began—Hans felt, for the first time in a long time, at peace with himself\nand what he was doing. He had always been terrified of plane turbulence, as if he might die with the best\ninside of him, but now he could fly through a violent storm sleeping like a baby. Strange indeed.\nMore than a year later, he was still getting unsolicited job offers from law firms, but by then had\nstarted Nexus Surf, 5 a premier surf-adventure company based in the tropical paradise of Florianopolis,\nBrazil. He had met his dream girl, a Carioca with caramel-colored skin named Tatiana, and spent most of\nhis time relaxing under palm trees or treating clients to the best times of their lives.\nIs this what he had been so afraid of?\nThese days, he often sees his former self in the underjoyed and overworked professionals he takes out\non the waves. Waiting for the swell, the true emotions come out: “God, I wish I could do what you do.”\nHis reply is always the same: “You can.”\nThe setting sun reflects off the surface of the water, providing a Zen-like setting for a message he\nknows is true: It’s not giving up to put your current path on indefinite pause. He could pick up his law\ncareer exactly where he left off if he wanted to, but that is the furthest thing from his mind.\nAs they paddle back to shore after an awesome session, his clients get ahold of themselves and regain\ntheir composure. They set foot on shore, and reality sinks its fangs in: “I would, but I can’t really throw it\nall away.”\nHe has to laugh.\nThe Power of Pessimism: Defining the Nightmare\nAction may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action.\n—BENJAMIN DISRAELI, former British Prime Minister\nTo door not to do? To try or not to try? Most people will vote no, whether they consider themselves\nbrave or not. Uncertainty and the prospect of failure can be very scary noises in the shadows. Most\npeople will choose unhappiness over uncertainty. For years, I set goals, made resolutions to change\ndirection, and nothing came of either. I was just as insecure and scared as the rest of the world.\nThe simple solution came to me accidentally four years ago. At that time, I had more money than I\nknew what to do with—I was making $70K or so per month—and I was completely miserable, worse\nthan ever. I had no time and was working myself to death. I had started my own company, only to realize\nit would be nearly impossible to sell. 6 Oops. I felt trapped and stupid at the same time. I should be able to\nfigure this out, I thought. Why am I such an idiot? Why can’t I make this work?! Buckle up and stop\nbeing such a (insert expletive)! What’s wrong with me? The truth was, nothing was wrong with me. I\nhadn’t reached my limit; I’d reached the limit of my business model at the time. It wasn’t the driver, it\nwas the vehicle.\nCritical mistakes in its infancy would never let me sell it. I could hire magic elves and connect my\nbrain to a supercomputer—it didn’t matter. My little baby had some serious birth defects. The question\nthen became, How do I free myself from this Frankenstein while making it self-sustaining? How do I pry\nmyself from the tentacles of workaholism and the fear that it would fall to pieces without my 15-hour\ndays? How do I escape this self-made prison? A trip, I decided. A sabbatical year around the world.\nSo I took the trip, right? Well, I’ll get to that. First, I felt it prudent to dance around with my shame,\nembarrassment, and anger for six months, all the while playing an endless loop of reasons why my copout\nfantasy trip could never work. One of my more productive periods, for sure.\nThen, one day, in my bliss of envisioning how bad my future suffering would be, I hit upon a gem of\nan idea. It was surely a highlight of my “don’t happy, be worry” phase: Why don’t I decide exactly what\nmy nightmare would be—the worst thing that could possibly happen as a result of my trip?\nWell, my business could fail while I’m overseas, for sure. Probably would. A legal warning letter\nwould accidentally not get forwarded and I would get sued. My business would be shut down, and\ninventory would spoil on the shelves while I’m picking my toes in solitary misery on some cold shore in\nIreland. Crying in the rain, I imagine. My bank account would crater by 80% and certainly my car and\nmotorcycle in storage would be stolen. I suppose someone would probably spit on my head from a highrise\nbalcony while I’m feeding food scraps to a stray dog, which would then spook and bite me squarely\non the face. God, life is a cruel, hard bitch.\nConquering Fear = Defining Fear\nSet aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and\ncheapest fare, with course and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: “Is this the condition\nthat I feared?”\n—SENECA\nThen a funny thing happened. In my undying quest to make myself miserable, I accidentally began to\nbackpedal. As soon as I cut through the vague unease and ambiguous anxiety by defining my nightmare,\nthe worst-case scenario, I wasn’t as worried about taking a trip. Suddenly, I started thinking of simple\nsteps I could take to salvage my remaining resources and get back on track if all hell struck at once. I\ncould always take a temporary bartending job to pay the rent if I had to. I could sell some furniture and\ncut back on eating out. I could steal lunch money from the kindergarteners who passed by my apartment\nevery morning. The options were many. I realized it wouldn’t be that hard to get back to where I was, let\nalone survive. None of these things would be fatal—not even close. Mere panty pinches on the journey\nof life.\nI realized that on a scale of 1–10, 1 being nothing and 10 being permanently life-changing, my socalled\nworst-case scenario might have a temporary impact of 3 or 4. I believe this is true of most people\nand most would-be “holy sh*t, my life is over” disasters. Keep in mind that this is the one-in-a-million\ndisaster nightmare. On the other hand, if I realized my best-case scenario, or even a probable-case\nscenario, it would easily have a permanent 9 or 10 positive life-changing effect.\nIn other words, I was risking an unlikely and temporary 3 or 4 for a probable and permanent 9 or 10,\nand I could easily recover my baseline workaholic prison with a bit of extra work if I wanted to. This all\nequated to a significant realization: There was practically no risk, only huge life-changing upside\npotential, and I could resume my previous course without any more effort than I was already putting\nforth.\nThat is when I made the decision to take the trip and bought a one-way ticket to Europe. I started\nplanning my adventures and eliminating my physical and psychological baggage. None of my disasters\ncame to pass, and my life has been a near fairy tale since. The business did better than ever, and I\npractically forgot about it as it financed my travels around the world in style for 15 months.\nUncovering Fear Disguised as Optimism\nThere’s no difference between a pessimist who says, “Oh, it’s hopeless, so don’t bother doing\nanything,” and an optimist who says, “Don’t bother doing anything, it’s going to turn out fine\nanyway.” Either way, nothing happens.\n—YVON CHOUINARD, 7 founder of Patagonia\nFear comes in many forms, and we usually don’t call it by its four-letter name. Fear itself is quite fearinducing.\nMost intelligent people in the world dress it up as something else: optimistic denial. Most who\navoid quitting their jobs entertain the thought that their course will improve with time or increases in\nincome. This seems valid and is a tempting hallucination when a job is boring or uninspiring instead of\npure hell. Pure hell forces action, but anything less can be endured with enough clever rationalization.\nDo you really think it will improve or is it wishful thinking and an excuse for inaction? If you were\nconfident in improvement, would you really be questioning things so? Generally not. This is fear of the\nunknown disguised as optimism.\nAre you better off than you were one year ago, one month ago, or one week ago?\nIf not, things will not improve by themselves. If you are kidding yourself, it is time to stop and plan\nfor a jump. Barring any James Dean ending, your life is going to be LONG. Nine to five for your\nworking lifetime of 40–50 years is a long-ass time if the rescue doesn’t come. About 500 months of solid\nwork.\nHow many do you have to go? It’s probably time to cut your losses.\nSomeone Call the Maître D’\nYou have comfort. You don’t have luxury. And don’t tell me that money plays a part. The\nluxury I advocate has nothing to do with money. It cannot be bought. It is the reward of those\nwho have no fear of discomfort.\n—JEAN COCTEAU, French poet, novelist, boxing manager, and filmmaker, whose\ncollaborations were the inspiration for the term “surrealism”\nSometimes timing is perfect. There are hundreds of cars circling a parking lot, and someone pulls out\nof a spot 10 feet from the entrance just as you reach his or her bumper. Another Christmas miracle!\nOther times, the timing could be better. The phone rings during sex and seems to ring for a half hour.\nThe UPS guy shows up 10 minutes later. Bad timing can spoil the fun.\nJean-Marc Hachey landed in West Africa as a volunteer, with high hopes of lending a helping hand. In\nthat sense, his timing was great. He arrived in Ghana in the early 1980s, in the middle of a coup d’état, at\nthe peak of hyperinflation, and just in time for the worst drought in a decade. For these same reasons,\nsome people would consider his timing quite poor from a more selfish survival standpoint.\nHe had also missed the memo. The national menu had changed, and they were out of luxuries like\nbread and clean water. He would be surviving for four months on a slushlike concoction of corn meal\nand spinach. Not what most of us would order at the movie theater.\n“WOW, I CAN SURVIVE.”\nJean-Marc had passed the point of no return, but it didn’t matter. After two weeks of adjusting to the\nbreakfast, lunch, and dinner (Mush à la Ghana), he had no desire to escape. The most basic of foods and\ngood friends proved to be the only real necessities, and what would seem like a disaster from the outside\nwas the most life-affirming epiphany he’d ever experienced: The worst really wasn’t that bad. To enjoy\nlife, you don’t need fancy nonsense, but you do need to control your time and realize that most things\njust aren’t as serious as you make them out to be.\nNow 48, Jean-Marc lives in a nice home in Ontario, but could live without it. He has cash, but could\nfall into poverty tomorrow and it wouldn’t matter. Some of his fondest memories still include nothing\nbut friends and gruel. He is dedicated to creating special moments for himself and his family and is\nutterly unconcerned with retirement. He’s already lived 20 years of partial retirement in perfect health.\nDon’t save it all for the end. There is every reason not to.\nQ&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS\nI am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened.\n—MARK TWAIN\nIf you are nervous about making the jump or simply putting it off out of fear of the unknown, here is\nyour antidote. Write down your answers, and keep in mind that thinking a lot will not prove as fruitful or\nas prolific as simply brain vomiting on the page. Write and do not edit—aim for volume. Spend a few\nminutes on each answer.\n1. Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are\nconsidering. What doubt, fears, and “what-ifs” pop up as you consider the big changes you can—\nor need—to make? Envision them in painstaking detail. Would it be the end of your life? What\nwould be the permanent impact, if any, on a scale of 1–10? Are these things really permanent?\nHow likely do you think it is that they would actually happen?\n2. What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing, even if\ntemporarily? Chances are, it’s easier than you imagine. How could you get things back under\ncontrol?\n3. What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable\nscenarios? Now that you’ve defined the nightmare, what are the more probable or definite positive\noutcomes, whether internal (confidence, self-esteem, etc.) or external? What would the impact of\nthese more-likely outcomes be on a scale of 1–10? How likely is it that you could produce at least\na moderately good outcome? Have less intelligent people done this before and pulled it off?\n4. If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial\ncontrol? Imagine this scenario and run through questions 1–3 above. If you quit your job to test\nother options, how could you later get back on the same career track if you absolutely had to?\n5. What are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to\ndo. That phone call, that conversation, whatever the action might be—it is fear of unknown\noutcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. Define the worst case, accept it, and do\nit. I’ll repeat something you might consider tattooing on your forehead: What we fear doing most is\nusually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be\nmeasured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to\ndo one thing every day that you fear. I got into this habit by attempting to contact celebrities and\nfamous businesspeople for advice.\n6. What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action? Don’t\nonly evaluate the potential downside of action. It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost\nof inaction. If you don’t pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in one year, five\nyears, and ten years? How will you feel having allowed circumstance to impose itself upon you\nand having allowed ten more years of your finite life to pass doing what you know will not fulfill\nyou? If you telescope out 10 years and know with 100% certainty that it is a path of\ndisappointment and regret, and if we define risk as “the likelihood of an irreversible negative\noutcome,” inaction is the greatest risk of all.\n7. What are you waiting for? If you cannot answer this without resorting to the previously rejected\nconcept of good timing, the answer is simple: You’re afraid, just like the rest of the world.\nMeasure the cost of inaction, realize the unlikelihood and re-pairability of most missteps, and\ndevelop the most important habit of those who excel and enjoy doing so: action.\n5. www.nexussurf.com\n6.

Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\n—GEORGE BERNARD SHAW, Maxims for Revolutionists\nSPRING 2005 / PRINCETON , NEW JERSEY\nI had to bribe them. What other choice did I have?\nThey formed a circle around me, and, while the names differed, the question was one and the same:\n“What’s the challenge?” All eyes were on me.\nMy lecture at Princeton University had just ended with excitement and enthusiasm. At the same time, I\nknew that most students would go out and promptly do the opposite of what I preached. Most of them\nwould be putting in 80-hour weeks as high-paid coffee fetchers unless I showed that the principles from\nclass could actually be applied.\nHence the challenge.\nI was offering a round-trip ticket anywhere in the world to anyone who could complete an undefined\n“challenge” in the most impressive fashion possible. Results plus style. I told them to meet me after class\nif interested, and here they were, nearly 20 out of 60 students.\nThe task was designed to test their comfort zones while forcing them to use some of the tactics I teach.\nIt was simplicity itself: Contact three seemingly impossible-to-reach people—J.Lo, Bill Clinton, J. D.\nSalinger, I don’t care—and get at least one to reply to three questions.\nOf 20 students, all frothing at the mouth to win a free spin across the globe, how many completed the\nchallenge?\nExactly … none. Not a one.\nThere were many excuses: “It’s not that easy to get someone to …” “I have a big paper due, and …”\n“I would love to, but there’s no way I can….” There was but one real reason, however, repeated over and\nover again in different words: It was a difficult challenge, perhaps impossible, and the other students\nwould outdo them. Since all of them overestimated the competition, no one even showed up.\nAccording to the rules I had set, if someone had sent me no more than an illegible one-paragraph\nresponse, I would have been obligated to give them the prize. This result both fascinated and depressed\nme.\nThe following year, the outcome was quite different.\nI told the above cautionary tale and 6 out of 17 finished the challenge in less than 48 hours. Was the\nsecond class better? No. In fact, there were more capable students in the first class, but they did nothing.\nFirepower up the wazoo and no trigger finger.\nThe second group just embraced what I told them before they started, which was …\nDoing the Unrealistic Is Easier Than Doing the Realistic\nFrom contacting billionaires to rubbing elbows with celebrities—the second group of students did both\n—it’s as easy as believing it can be done.\nIt’s lonely at the top. Ninety-nine percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of\nachieving great things, so they aim for the mediocre. The level of competition is thus fiercest for\n“realistic” goals, paradoxically making them the most time-and energy-consuming. It is easier to raise\n$1,000,000 than it is $100,000. It is easier to pick up the one perfect 10 in the bar than the five 8s.\nIf you are insecure, guess what? The rest of the world is, too. Do not overestimate the competition and\nunderestimate yourself. You are better than you think.\nUnreasonable and unrealistic goals are easier to achieve for yet another reason.\nHaving an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that provides the endurance to overcome the\ninevitable trials and tribulations that go along with any goal. Realistic goals, goals restricted to the\naverage ambition level, are uninspiring and will only fuel you through the first or second problem, at\nwhich point you throw in the towel. If the potential payoff is mediocre or average, so is your effort. I’ll\nrun through walls to get a catamaran trip through the Greek islands, but I might not change my brand of\ncereal for a weekend trip through Columbus, Ohio. If I choose the latter because it is “realistic,” I won’t\nhave the enthusiasm to jump even the smallest hurdle to accomplish it. With beautiful, crystal-clear\nGreek waters and delicious wine on the brain, I’m prepared to do battle for a dream that is worth\ndreaming. Even though their difficulty of achievement on a scale of 1–10 appears to be a 10 and a 2\nrespectively, Columbus is more likely to fall through.\nThe fishing is best where the fewest go, and the collective insecurity of the world makes it easy for\npeople to hit home runs while everyone else is aiming for base hits. There is just less competition for\nbigger goals.\nDoing big things begins with asking for them properly.\nWhat Do You Want? A Better Question, First of All\nMost people will never know what they want. I don’t know what I want. If you ask me what I want\nto do in the next five months for language learning, on the other hand, I do know. It’s a matter of\nspecificity. “What do you want?” is too imprecise to produce a meaningful and actionable answer. Forget\nabout it.\n“What are your goals?” is similarly fated for confusion and guesswork. To rephrase the question, we\nneed to take a step back and look at the bigger picture.\nLet’s assume we have 10 goals and we achieve them—what is the desired outcome that makes all the\neffort worthwhile? The most common response is what I also would have suggested five years ago:\nhappiness. I no longer believe this is a good answer. Happiness can be bought with a bottle of wine and\nhas become ambiguous through overuse. There is a more precise alternative that reflects what I believe\nthe actual objective is.\nBear with me. What is the opposite of happiness? Sadness? No. Just as love and hate are two sides of\nthe same coin, so are happiness and sadness. Crying out of happiness is a perfect illustration of this. The\nopposite of love is indifference, and the opposite of happiness is—here’s the clincher—boredom.\nExcitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to\nchase. It is the cure-all. When people suggest you follow your “passion” or your “bliss,” I propose that\nthey are, in fact, referring to the same singular concept: excitement.\nThis brings us full circle. The question you should be asking isn’t, “What do I want?” or “What are\nmy goals?” but “What would excite me?”\nAdult-Onset ADD: Adventure Deficit Disorder\nSomewhere between college graduation and your second job, a chorus enters your internal dialogue:\nBe realistic and stop pretending. Life isn’t like the movies.\nIf you’re five years old and say you want to be an astronaut, your parents tell you that you can be\nanything you want to be. It’s harmless, like telling a child that Santa Claus exists. If you’re 25 and\nannounce you want to start a new circus, the response is different: Be realistic; become a lawyer or an\naccountant or a doctor, have babies, and raise them to repeat the cycle.\nIf you do manage to ignore the doubters and start your own business, for example, ADD doesn’t\ndisappear. It just takes a different form.\nWhen I started BrainQUICKEN LLC in 2001, it was with a clear goal in mind: Make $1,000 per day\nwhether I was banging my head on a laptop or cutting my toenails on the beach. It was to be an\nautomated source of cash flow. If you look at my chronology, it is obvious that this didn’t happen until a\nmeltdown forced it, despite the requisite income. Why? The goal wasn’t specific enough. I hadn’t\ndefined alternate activities that would replace the initial workload. Therefore, I just continued working,\neven though there was no financial need. I needed to feel productive and had no other vehicles.\nThis is how most people work until death: “I’ll just work until I have X dollars and then do what I\nwant.” If you don’t define the “what I want” alternate activities, the X figure will increase indefinitely to\navoid the fear-inducing uncertainty of this void.\nThis is when both employees and entrepreneurs become fat men in red BMWs.\nThe Fat Man in the Red BMW Convertible\nThere have been several points in my life—among them, just before I was fired from TrueSAN and\njust before I escaped the U.S. to avoid taking an Uzi into McDonald’s—at which I saw my future as\nanother fat man in a midlife-crisis BMW. I simply looked at those who were 15–20 years ahead of me on\nthe same track, whether a director of sales or an entrepreneur in the same industry, and it scared the hell\nout of me.\nIt was such an acute phobia, and such a perfect metaphor for the sum of all fears, that it became a\npattern interrupt between myself and fellow lifestyle designer and entrepreneur Douglas Price. Doug and\nI traveled parallel paths for nearly five years, facing the same challenges and self-doubt and thus keeping\na close psychological eye on each other. Our down periods seem to alternate, making us a good team.\nWhenever one of us began to set our sights lower, lose faith, or “accept reality,” the other would\nchime in via phone or e-mail like an A A sponsor: “Dude, are you turning into the bald fat man in the\nred BMW convertible?” The prospect was terrifying enough that we always got our asses and priorities\nback on track immediately. The worst that could happen wasn’t crashing and burning, it was accepting\nterminal boredom as a tolerable status quo.\nRemember—boredom is the enemy, not some abstract “failure.”\nCorrecting Course: Get Unrealistic\nThere is a process that I have used, and still use, to reignite life or correct course when the Fat Man in\nthe BMW rears his ugly head. In some form or another, it is the same process used by the most\nimpressive NR I have met around the world: dreamlining. Dreamlining is so named because it applies\ntimelines to what most would consider dreams.\nIt is much like goal-setting but differs in several fundamental respects:\n1. The goals shift from ambiguous wants to defined steps.\n2. The goals have to be unrealistic to be effective.\n3. It focuses on activities that will fill the vacuum created when work is removed. Living like a\nmillionaire requires doing interesting things and not just owning enviable things.\nNow it’s your turn to think big.\nHow to Get George Bush Sr. or the\nCEO of Google on the Phone\nThe article below, titled “Fail Better” and written by Adam Gottesfeld, explores how I teach Princeton\nstudents to connect with luminary-level business mentors and celebrities of various types. I’ve edited it\nfor length in a few places.\nPeople are fond of using the “it’s not what you know, it’s who you know” adage as an excuse for\ninaction, as if all successful people are born with powerful friends.\nNonsense.\nHere’s how normal people build supernormal networks.\nFail Better\nBY ADAM GOTTESFELD\nMOST PRINCETON students love to procrastinate in writing their dean’s date [term] papers. Ryan Marrinan\n’07, from Los Angeles, was no exception. But while the majority of undergraduates fill their time by\nupdating their Facebook profiles or watching videos on YouTube, Marrinan was discussing Soto Zen\nBuddhism via e-mail with Randy Komisar, a partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield\nand Byers, and asking Google CEO Eric Schmidt via e-mail when he had been happiest in his life.\n(Schmidt’s answer: “Tomorrow.”)\nPrior to his e-mail, Marrinan had never contacted Komisar. He had met Schmidt, a Princeton\nUniversity trustee, only briefly at an academic affairs meeting of the trustees in November. A selfdescribed\n“naturally shy kid,” Marrinan said he would never have dared to randomly e-mail two of the\nmost powerful men in Silicon Valley if it weren’t for Tim Ferriss, who offered a guest lecture in\nProfessor Ed Zschau’s “High-Tech Entrepreneurship” class. Ferriss challenged Marrinan and his fellow\nseniors to contact high-profile celebrities and CEOs and get their answers to questions they have always\nwanted to ask.\nFor extra incentive, Ferriss promised the student who could contact the most hard-to-reach name and\nask the most intriguing question a round-trip plane ticket anywhere in the world.\n“I believe that success can be measured in the number of uncomfortable conversations you’re willing\nto have. I felt that if I could help students overcome the fear of rejection with cold-calling and cold e-\nmail, it would serve them forever,” Ferriss said. “It’s easy to sell yourself short, but when you see\nclassmates getting responses from people like [former president] George Bush, the CEOs of Disney,\nComcast, Google, and HP, and dozens of other impossible-to-reach people, it forces you to reconsider\nyour self-set limitations.” … Ferriss lectures to the students of “High-Tech Entrepreneurship” each\nsemester about creating a startup and designing the ideal lifestyle.\n“I participate in this contest every day,” said Ferriss. “I do what I always do: find a personal e-mail if\npossible, often through their little-known personal blogs, send a two- to three-paragraph e-mail which\nexplains that I am familiar with their work, and ask one simple-to-answer but thought-provoking\nquestion in that e-mail related to their work or life philosophies. The goal is to start a dialogue so they\ntake the time to answer future e-mails—not to ask for help. That can only come after at least three or\nfour genuine e-mail exchanges.”\nWith “textbook execution of the Tim Ferriss Technique,” as he put it, Marrinan was able to strike up a\nbond with Komisar. In his initial e-mail, he talked about reading one of Komisar’s Harvard Business\nReview articles and feeling inspired to ask him, “When were you happiest in your life?” After Komisar\nreplied with references to Tibetan Buddhism, Marrinan responded, “Just as words are inadequate to\nexplain true happiness, so too are words inadequate to express my thanks.” His e-mail included his\npersonal translation of a French poem by Taisen Deshimaru, the former European head of Soto Zen. An\ne-mail relationship was formed, and Komisar even e-mailed Marrinan a few days later with a link to a\nNew York Times article on happiness.\nContacting Schmidt proved more challenging. For Marrinan, the toughest part was getting Schmidt’s\npersonal e-mail address. He e-mailed a Princeton dean asking for it. No response. Two weeks later, he e-\nmailed the same dean again, defending his request by reminding her that he had previously met Schmidt.\nThe dean said no, but Marrinan refused to give up. He e-mailed her a third time. “Have you ever made\nan exception?” he asked. The dean finally gave in, he said, and provided him with Schmidt’s e-mail.\n“I know some of my classmates pursued the alternative scattershot technique with some success, but\nthat’s not my bag,” Marrinan said, explaining his perseverance. “I deal with rejection by persisting, not\nby taking my business elsewhere. My maxim comes from Samuel Beckett, a personal hero of mine:\n‘Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.’ You won’t believe what you can\naccomplish by attempting the impossible with the courage to repeatedly fail better.”\nNathan Kaplan, another participant in the contest, was most proud of the way that he was able to\ncontact former Newark mayor Sharpe James. Because James had made a campaign contribution to Al\nSharpton, the website www.fundrace.org listed James’s home address. Kaplan then input James’s address\ninto an online serach-by-address phone directory, through which he received the former mayor’s phone\nnumber. Kaplan left a message for James, and a few days later finally got to ask him about childhood\neducation.\nFerriss is proud of the effort students have put into his contest. “Most people can do absolutely aweinspiring\nthings,” he said. “Sometimes they just need a little nudge.”\nQ&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS\nThe existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom.\n—VIKTOR FRANKL, Auschwitz survivor and founder of Logotherapy, Man’s Search for Meaning\nLife is too short to be small.\n—BENJAMIN DISRAELI\nDreamlining will be fun, and it will be hard. The harder it is, the more you need it. To save time, I\nrecommend using the automatic calculators and forms at www.fourhourblog.com. Refer to the model\nworksheet as you complete the following steps:\n1. What would you do if there were no way you could fail? If you were 10 times smarter than the\nrest of the world?\nCreate two timelines—6 months and 12 months—and list up to five things you dream of having\n(including, but not limited to, material wants: house, car, clothing, etc.), being (be a great cook, be fluent\nin Chinese, etc.), and doing (visiting Thailand, tracing your roots overseas, racing ostriches, etc.) in that\norder. If you have difficulty identifying what you want in some categories, as most will, consider what\nyou hate or fear in each and write down the opposite. Do not limit yourself, and do not concern yourself\nwith how these things will be accomplished. For now, it’s unimportant. This is an exercise in reversing\nrepression.\nBe sure not to judge or fool yourself. If you really want a Ferrari, don’t put down solving world\nhunger out of guilt. For some, the dream will be fame, for others fortune or prestige. All people have\ntheir vices and insecurities. If something will improve your feeling of self-worth, put it down. I have a\nracing motorcycle, and quite apart from the fact that I love speed, it just makes me feel like a cool dude.\nThere is nothing wrong with that. Put it all down.\n2. Drawing a blank?\nFor all their bitching about what’s holding them back, most people have a lot of trouble coming up with\nthe defined dreams they’re being held from. This is particularly true with the “doing” category. In that\ncase, consider these questions:\n1. What would you do, day to day, if you had $100 million in the bank?\n2. What would make you most excited to wake up in the morning to another day?\nDon’t rush—think about it for a few minutes. If still blocked, fill in the five “doing” spots with the\nfollowing:\none place to visit\none thing to do before you die (a memory of a lifetime)\none thing to do daily\none thing to do weekly\none thing you’ve always wanted to learn\n3. What does “being” entail doing?\nConvert each “being” into a “doing” to make it actionable. Identify an action that would characterize this\nstate of being or a task that would mean you had achieved it. People find it easier to brainstorm “being”\nfirst, but this column is just a temporary holding spot for “doing” actions. Here are a few examples:\nGreat cook\nmake Christmas dinner without help\nFluent in Chinese have a five-minute conversation\nwith a Chinese co-worker\n4. What are the four dreams that would change it all?\nUsing the 6-month timeline, star or otherwise highlight the four most exciting and/or important dreams\nfrom all columns. Repeat the process with the 12-month timeline if desired.\n5. Determine the cost of these dreams and calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for both\ntimelines.\nIf financeable, what is the cost per month for each of the four dreams (rent, mortgage, payment plan\ninstallments, etc.)? Start thinking of income and expense in terms of monthly cash flow—dollars in and\ndollars out—instead of grand totals. Things often cost much, much less than expected. For example, a\nLamborghini Gallardo Spyder, fresh off the showroom floor at $260,000, can be had for $2,897.80 per\nmonth. I found my personal favorite, an Aston Martin DB9 with 1,000 miles on it, through eBay for\n$136,000—$2,003.10 per month. How about a Round-the-World trip (Los Angeles Tokyo\nSingapore Bangkok Delhi or Bombay London Frankfurt Los Angeles) for $1,399?\nFor some of these costs, the Tools and Tricks at the end of Chapter 14 will help.\nLast, calculate your Target Monthly Income (TMI) for realizing these dreamlines. This is how to do it:\nFirst, total each of the columns A, B, and C, counting only the four selected dreams. Some of these\ncolumn totals could be zero, which is fine. Next, add your total monthly expenses x 1.3 (the 1.3\nrepresents your expenses plus a 30% buffer for safety or savings). This grand total is your TMI and the\ntarget to keep in mind for the rest of the book. I like to further divide this TMI by 30 to get my TDI—\nTarget Daily Income. I find it easier to work with a daily goal. Online calculators on our companion site\ndo all the work for you and make this step a cinch.\nChances are that the figure is lower than expected, and it often decreases over time as you trade more\nand more “having” for once-in-a-lifetime “doing.” Mobility encourages this trend. Even if the total is\nintimidating, don’t fret in the least. I have helped students get to more than $10,000 per month in extra\nincome within three months.\nSample Dreamline\nDreamline\n(Go to www.fourhourblog.com for larger printable worksheets and online calculators.)\nDreamline Math—Another Good Option\nThere could be a different way of handling monthly and one-time goals. I’ll use your example of an\nAston Martin’s monthly payment, a personal assistant’s monthly payment, and a trip to the Croatian\ncoast. While the first two should certainly be totaled and included in your target monthly income, the trip\nis something that should be divided by the number of months between now and the dreamline’s total\ntime.\nThus if you had a six-month dreamline:\nAston Martin = 2,003 per month\nPersonal assistant = 400 per month\nCroatian trip = 934 total, and thus 934/6 per month\nRight now in the book and in the spreadsheet we have (2003 + 400 + 934) x 1.3 monthly expenses =\nTarget Monthly Income (or TMI).\nBut I think it should be (2003 + 400 + 934/6 x 1.3 monthly expenses = TMI.\nOr, more generally: [Monthly Goals + (One-Time Goals / Total Months)] x 1.3 monthly expenses =\nTMI.\n— JARED , president, SET Consulting\n6. Determine three steps for each of the four dreams in just the 6-month timeline and take the first\nstep now.\nI’m not a big believer in long-term planning and far-off goals. In fact, I generally set 3-month and 6-\nmonth dreamlines. The variables change too much and in-the-future distance becomes an excuse for\npostponing action. The objective of this exercise isn’t, therefore, to outline every step from start to finish,\nbut to define the end goal, the required vehicle to achieve them (TMI, TDI), and build momentum with\ncritical first steps. From that point, it’s a matter of freeing time and generating the TMI, which the\nfollowing chapters cover.\nFirst, let’s focus on those critical first steps. Define three steps for each dream that will get you closer\nto its actualization. Set actions—simple, well-defined actions—for now, tomorrow (complete before 11\nA.M.) and the day after (again completed before 11 A.M.).\nOnce you have three steps for each of the four goals, complete the three actions in the “now” column.\nDo it now. Each should be simple enough to do in five minutes or less. If not, rachet it down. If it’s the\nmiddle of the night and you can’t call someone, do something else now, such as send an e-mail, and set\nthe call for first thing tomorrow.\nIf the next stage is some form of research, get in touch with someone who knows the answer instead of\nspending too much time in books or online, which can turn into paralysis by analysis. The best first step,\nthe one I recommend, is finding someone who’s done it and ask for advice on how to do the same. It’s\nnot hard.\nOther options include setting a meeting or phone call with a trainer, mentor, or salesperson to build\nmomentum. Can you schedule a private class or a commitment that you’ll feel bad about canceling? Use\nguilt to your advantage.\nTomorrow becomes never. No matter how small the task, take the first step now!\nCOMFORT CHALLENGE\nThe most important actions are never comfortable.\nFortunately, it is possible to condition yourself to discomfort and overcome it. I’ve trained myself to\npropose solutions instead of ask for them, to elicit desired responses instead of react, and to be assertive\nwithout burning bridges. To have an uncommon lifestyle, you need to develop the uncommon habit of\nmaking decisions, both for yourself and for others.\nFrom this chapter forward, I’ll take you through progressively more uncomfortable exercises, simple\nand small. Some of the exercises will appear deceptively easy and even irrelevant (such as the next) until\nyou try them. Look at it as a game and expect some butterflies and sweat—that’s the whole point. For\nmost of these exercises, the duration is two days. Mark the exercise of the day on your calendar so you\ndon’t forget, and don’t attempt more than one Comfort Challenge at a time.\nRemember: There is a direct correlation between an increased sphere of comfort and getting what you\nwant.\nHere we go.\nLearn to Eye Gaze (2 days)\nMy friend Michael Ellsberg invented a singles event called Eye Gazing. It is similar to speed dating but\ndifferent in one fundamental respect—no speaking is permitted. It involves gazing into the eyes of each\npartner for three minutes at a time. If you go to such an event, it becomes clear how uncomfortable most\npeople are doing this. For the next two days, practice gazing into the eyes of others—whether people you\npass on the street or conversational partners—until they break contact. Hints:\n1. Focus on one eye and be sure to blink occasionally so you don’t look like a psychopath or get your\nass kicked.\n2. In conversation, maintain eye contact when you are speaking. It’s easy to do while listening.\n3. Practice with people bigger or more confident than yourself. If a passerby asks you what the hell\nyou’re staring at, just smile and respond, “Sorry about that. I thought you were an old friend of\nmine.”\nStep II:\nE is for Elimination\nOne does not accumulate but eliminate .\nIt is not daily increase but daily\ndecrease. The height of cultivation\nalways runs to simplicity .\n—BRUCE LEE\nThe End of Time Management\nILLUSIONS AND ITALIANS\nPerfection is not when there is no more to add, but no more to take away.\n—ANTOINE DE SAINT-EXUPÉRY, pioneer of international postal flight and author of Le Petit\nPrince (The Little Prince)\nIt is vain to do with more what can be done with less.\n—WILLIAM OF OCCAM (1300–1350), originator of “Occam’s Razor”\nJust a few words on time management: Forget all about it.\nIn the strictest sense, you shouldn’t be trying to do more in each day, trying to fill every second with a\nwork fidget of some type. It took me a long time to figure this out. I used to be very fond of the resultsby-volume\napproach.\nBeing busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable\nactions. The options are almost limitless for creating “busyness”: You could call a few hundred\nunqualified sales leads, reorganize your Outlook contacts, walk across the office to request documents\nyou don’t really need, or fuss with your BlackBerry for a few hours when you should be prioritizing.\nIn fact, if you want to move up the ladder in most of corporate America, and assuming they don’t\nreally check what you are doing (let’s be honest), just run around the office holding a cell phone to your\nhead and carrying papers. Now, that is one busy employee! Give them a raise. Unfortunately for the NR,\nthis behavior won’t get you out of the office or put you on an airplane to Brazil. Bad dog. Hit yourself\nwith a newspaper and cut it out.\nAfter all, there is a far better option, and it will do more than simply increase your results—it will\nmultiply them. Believe it or not, it is not only possible to accomplish more by doing less, it is mandatory.\nEnter the world of elimination.\nHow You Will Use Productivity\nNow that you have defined what you want to do with your time, you have to free that time. The trick,\nof course, is to do so while maintaining or increasing your income.\nThe intention of this chapter, and what you will experience if you follow the instructions, is an\nincrease in personal productivity between 100 and 500%. The principles are the same for both employees\nand entrepreneurs, but the purpose of this increased productivity is completely different.\nFirst, the employee. The employee is increasing productivity to increase negotiating leverage for two\nsimultaneous objectives: pay raises and a remote working arrangement.\nRecall that, as indicated in the first chapter of this book, the general process of joining the New Rich is\nD-E-A-L, in that order, but that employees intent on remaining employees for now need to implement\nthe process as D-E-L-A. The reason relates to environment. They need to Liberate themselves from the\noffice environment before they can work ten hours a week, for example, because the expectation in that\nenvironment is that you will be in constant motion from 9–5. Even if you produce twice the results you\nhad in the past, if you’re working a quarter of the hours of your colleagues, there is a good chance of\nreceiving a pink slip. Even if you work 10 hours a week and produce twice the results of people working\n40, the collective request will be, “Work 40 hours a week and produce 8 times the results.” This is an\nendless game and one you want to avoid. Hence the need for Liberation first.\nIf you’re an employee, this chapter will increase your value and make it more painful for the company\nto fire you than to grant raises and a remote working agreement. That is your goal. Once the latter is\naccomplished, you can drop hours without bureaucratic interference and use the resultant free time to\nfulfill dreamlines.\nThe entrepreneur’s goals are less complex, as he or she is generally the direct beneficiary of increased\nprofit. The goal is to decrease the amount of work you perform while increasing revenue. This will set\nthe stage for replacing yourself with Automation, which in turn permits Liberation.\nFor both tracks, some definitions are in order.\nBeing Effective vs. Being Efficient\nEffectiveness is doing the things that get you closer to your goals. Efficiency is performing a given\ntask (whether important or not) in the most economical manner possible. Being efficient without regard\nto effectiveness is the default mode of the universe.\nI would consider the best door-to-door salesperson efficient—that is, refined and excellent at selling\ndoor-to-door without wasting time—but utterly ineffective. He or she would sell more using a better\nvehicle such as e-mail or direct mail.\nThis is also true for the person who checks e-mail 30 times per day and develops an elaborate system\nof folder rules and sophisticated techniques for ensuring that each of those 30 brain farts moves as\nquickly as possible. I was a specialist at such professional wheel-spinning. It is efficient on some\nperverse level, but far from effective.\nHere are two truisms to keep in mind:\n1. Doing something unimportant well does not make it important.\n2. Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important.\nFrom this moment forward, remember this: What you do is infinitely more important than how you do\nit. Efficiency is still important, but it is useless unless applied to the right things.\nTo find the right things, we’ll need to go to the garden.\nPareto and His Garden: 80/20 and\nFreedom from Futility\nWhat gets measured gets managed.\n—PETER DRUCKER, management theorist, author of 31 books, recipient of Presidential Medal of\nFreedom\nFour years ago, an economist changed my life forever. It’s a shame I never had a chance to buy him a\ndrink. My dear Vilfredo died almost 100 years ago.\nVilfredo Pareto was a wily and controversial economist-cum-sociologist who lived from 1848 to 1923.\nAn engineer by training, he started his varied career managing coal mines and later succeeded Léon\nWalras as the chair of political economy at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. His seminal work,\nCours d’economie politique, included a then little-explored “law” of income distribution that would later\nbear his name: “Pareto’s Law” or the “Pareto Distribution,” in the last decade also popularly called the\n“80/20 Principle.”\nThe mathematical formula he used to demonstrate a grossly uneven but predictable distribution of\nwealth in society—80% of the wealth and income was produced and possessed by 20% of the population\n—also applied outside of economics. Indeed, it could be found almost everywhere. Eighty percent of\nPareto’s garden peas were produced by 20% of the peapods he had planted, for example.\nPareto’s Law can be summarized as follows: 80% of the outputs result from 20% of the inputs.\nAlternative ways to phrase this, depending on the context, include:\n80% of the consequences flow from 20% of the causes.\n80% of the results come from 20% of the effort and time.\n80% of company profits come from 20% of the products and customers.\n80% of all stock market gains are realized by 20% of the investors and 20% of an individual portfolio.\nThe list is infinitely long and diverse, and the ratio is often skewed even more severely: 90/10, 95/5, and\n99/1 are not uncommon, but the minimum ratio to seek is 80/20.\nWhen I came across Pareto’s work one late evening, I had been slaving away with 15-hour days seven\ndays per week, feeling completely overwhelmed and generally helpless. I would wake up before dawn to\nmake calls to the United Kingdom, handle the U.S. during the normal 9–5 day, and then work until near\nmidnight making calls to Japan and New Zealand. I was stuck on a runaway freight train with no brakes,\nshoveling coal into the furnace for lack of a better option. Faced with certain burnout or giving Pareto’s\nideas a trial run, I opted for the latter. The next morning, I began a dissection of my business and\npersonal life through the lenses of two questions:\n1. Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?\n2. Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?\nFor the entire day, I put aside everything seemingly urgent and did the most intense truth-baring\nanalysis possible, applying these questions to everything from my friends to customers and advertising to\nrelaxation activities. Don’t expect to find you’re doing everything right—the truth often hurts. The goal is\nto find your inefficiencies in order to eliminate them and to find your strengths so you can multiply them.\nIn the 24 hours that followed, I made several simple but emotionally difficult decisions that literally\nchanged my life forever and enabled the lifestyle I now enjoy.\nThe first decision I made is an excellent example of how dramatic and fast the ROI of this analytical\nfat-cutting can be: I stopped contacting 95% of my customers and fired 2%, leaving me with the top 3%\nof producers to profile and duplicate.\nOut of more than 120 wholesale customers, a mere 5 were bringing in 95% of the revenue. I was\nspending 98% of my time chasing the remainder, as the aforementioned 5 ordered regularly without any\nfollow-up calls, persuasion, or cajoling. In other words, I was working because I felt as though I should\nbe doing something from 9–5. I didn’t realize that working every hour from 9–5 isn’t the goal; it’s\nsimply the structure most people use, whether it’s necessary or not. I had a severe case of work-for-work\n(W4W), the most-hated acronym in the NR vocabulary.\nAll, and I mean 100%, of my problems and complaints came from this unproductive majority, with\nthe exception of two large customers who were simply world-class experts of the “here is the fire I\nstarted, now you put it out” approach to business. I put all of these unproductive customers on passive\nmode: If they ordered, great—let them fax in the order. If not, I would do absolutely no chasing: no\nphone calls, no e-mail, nothing. That left the two larger customers to deal with, who were professional\nball breakers but contributed about 10% to the bottom line at the time.\nYou’ll always have a few of these, and it is a quandary that causes all sorts of problems, not the least\nof which are self-hatred and depression. Up to that point, I had taken their browbeating, insults, timeconsuming\narguments, and tirades as a cost of doing business. I realized during the 80/20 analysis that\nthese two people were the source of nearly all my unhappiness and anger throughout the day, and it\nusually spilled over into my personal time, keeping me up at night with the usual “I should have said X,\nY, and Z to that penis” self-flagellation. I finally concluded the obvious: The effect on my self-esteem\nand state of mind just wasn’t worth the financial gain. I didn’t need the money for any precise reason,\nand I had assumed I needed to take it. The customers are always right, aren’t they? Part of doing\nbusiness, right? Hell, no. Not for the NR, anyway. I fired their asses and enjoyed every second of it. The\nfirst conversation went like this:\nCustomer: What the &#@$? I ordered two cases and they arrived two days late. [Note: He had sent the\norder to the wrong person via the wrong medium, despite repeated reminders.] You guys are the most\ndisorganized bunch of idiots I’ve ever worked with. I have 20 years of experience in this industry, and\nthis is the worst.\nAny NR—in this case, me: I will kill you. Be afraid, be very afraid.\nI wish. I did rehearse that a million times in my mental theater, but it actually went something more like\nthis:\nI’m sorry to hear that. You know, I’ve been taking your insults for a while now, and it’s unfortunate that\nit seems we won’t be able to do business anymore. I’d recommend you take a good look at where this\nunhappiness and anger is actually coming from. In any case, I wish you well. If you would like to order\nproduct, we’ll be happy to supply it, but only if you can conduct yourself without profanity and\nunnecessary insults. You have our fax number. All the best and have a nice day. [Click.]\nI did this once via phone and once through e-mail. So what happened? I lost one customer, but the\nother corrected course and simply faxed orders, again and again and again. Problem solved, minimum\nrevenue lost. I was immediately 10 times happier.\nI then identified the common characteristics of my top-five customers and secured three or so similarly\nprofiled buyers in the following week. Remember, more customers is not automatically more income.\nMore customers is not the goal and often translates into 90% more housekeeping and a paltry 1–3%\nincrease in income. Make no mistake, maximum income from minimal necessary effort (including\nminimum number of customers) is the primary goal. I duplicated my strengths, in this case my top\nproducers, and focused on increasing the size and frequency of their orders.\nThe end result? I went from chasing and appeasing 120 customers to simply receiving large orders\nfrom 8, with absolutely no pleading phone calls or e-mail haranguing. My monthly income increased\nfrom $30K to $60K in four weeks and my weekly hours immediately dropped from over 80 to\napproximately 15. Most important, I was happy with myself and felt both optimistic and liberated for the\nfirst time in over two years.\nIn the ensuing weeks, I applied the 80/20 Principle to dozens of areas, including the following:\n1. Advertising\nI identified the advertising that was generating 80% or more of revenue, identified the commonalities\namong them, and multiplied them, eliminating all the rest at the same time. My advertising costs dropped\nover 70% and my direct sales income nearly doubled from a monthly $15K to $25K in 8 weeks. It would\nhave doubled immediately had I been using radio, newspapers, or television instead of magazines with\nlong lead times.\n2. Online Affiliates and Partners\nI fired more than 250 low-yield online affiliates or put them in holding patterns to focus instead on the\ntwo affiliates who were generating 90% of the income. My management time decreased from 5–10 hours\nper week to 1 hour per month. Online partner income increased more than 50% in that same month.\nSlow down and remember this: Most things make no difference. Being busy is a form of laziness—lazy\nthinking and indiscriminate action.\nBeing overwhelmed is often as unproductive as doing nothing, and is far more unpleasant. Being\nselective—doing less—is the path of the productive. Focus on the important few and ignore the rest.\nOf course, before you can separate the wheat from the chaff and eliminate activities in a new\nenvironment (whether a new job or an entrepreneurial venture), you will need to try a lot to identify what\npulls the most weight. Throw it all up on the wall and see what sticks. That’s part of the process, but it\nshould not take more than a month or two.\nIt’s easy to get caught in a flood of minutiae, and the key to not feeling rushed is remembering that\nlack of time is actually lack of priorities. Take time to stop and smell the roses, or—in this case—to\ncount the pea pods.\nThe 9–5 Illusion and Parkinson’s Law\nI saw a bank that said “24-Hour Banking,” but I don’t have that much time.\n—STEVEN WRIGHT, comedian\nIf you’re an employee, spending time on nonsense is, to some extent, not your fault. There is often no\nincentive to use time well unless you are paid on commission. The world has agreed to shuffle papers\nbetween 9:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M., and since you’re trapped in the office for that period of servitude, you\nare compelled to create activities to fill that time. Time is wasted because there is so much time available.\nIt’s understandable. Now that you have the new goal of negotiating a remote work arrangement instead\nof just collecting a paycheck, it’s time to revisit the status quo and become effective. The best employees\nhave the most leverage.\nFor the entrepreneur, the wasteful use of time is a matter of bad habit and imitation. I am no\nexception. Most entrepreneurs were once employees and come from the 9–5 culture. Thus they adopt the\nsame schedule, whether or not they function at 9:00 A.M. or need 8 hours to generate their target income.\nThis schedule is a collective social agreement and a dinosaur legacy of the results-by-volume approach.\nHow is it possible that all the people in the world need exactly 8 hours to accomplish their work? It isn’t.\n9–5 is arbitrary.\nYou don’t need 8 hours per day to become a legitimate millionaire—let alone have the means to live\nlike one. Eight hours per week is often excessive, but I don’t expect all of you to believe me just yet. I\nknow you probably feel as I did for a long time: There just aren’t enough hours in the day.\nBut let’s consider a few things we can probably agree on.\nSince we have 8 hours to fill, we fill 8 hours. If we had 15, we would fill 15. If we have an emergency\nand need to suddenly leave work in 2 hours but have pending deadlines, we miraculously complete those\nassignments in 2 hours.\nIt is all related to a law that was introduced to me by Ed Zschau in the spring of 2000.\nI had arrived to class nervous and unable to concentrate. The final paper, worth a full 25% of the\nsemester’s grade, was due in 24 hours. One of the options, and that which I had chosen, was to interview\nthe top executives of a start-up and provide an in-depth analysis of their business model. The corporate\npowers that be had decided last minute that I couldn’t interview two key figures or use their information\ndue to confidentiality issues and pre-IPO precautions. Game over.\nI approached Ed after class to deliver the bad news.\n“Ed, I think I’m going to need an extension on the paper.” I explained the situation, and Ed smiled\nbefore he replied without so much as a hint of concern.\n“I think you’ll be OK. Entrepreneurs are those who make things happen, right?”\nTwenty-four hours later and one minute before the deadline, as his assistant was locking the office, I\nhanded in a 30-page final paper. It was based on a different company I had found, interviewed, and\ndissected with an intense all-nighter and enough caffeine to get an entire Olympic track team\ndisqualified. It ended up being one of the best papers I’d written in four years, and I received an A.\nBefore I left the classroom the previous day, Ed had given me some parting advice: Parkinson’s Law.\nParkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to\nthe time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline. If I give you 24 hours to\ncomplete a project, the time pressure forces you to focus on execution, and you have no choice but to do\nonly the bare essentials. If I give you a week to complete the same task, it’s six days of making a\nmountain out of a molehill. If I give you two months, God forbid, it becomes a mental monster. The end\nproduct of the shorter deadline is almost inevitably of equal or higher quality due to greater focus.\nThis presents a very curious phenomenon. There are two synergistic approaches for increasing\nproductivity that are inversions of each other:\n1. Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20).\n2. Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson’s Law).\nThe best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income\nand schedule them with very short and clear deadlines.\nIf you haven’t identified the mission-critical tasks and set aggressive start and end times for their\ncompletion, the unimportant becomes the important. Even if you know what’s critical, without deadlines\nthat create focus, the minor tasks forced upon you (or invented, in the case of the entrepreneur) will swell\nto consume time until another bit of minutiae jumps in to replace it, leaving you at the end of the day\nwith nothing accomplished. How else could dropping off a package at UPS, setting a few appointments,\nand checking e-mail consume an entire 9–5 day? Don’t feel bad. I spent months jumping from one\ninterruption to the next, feeling run by my business instead of the other way around.\nTHE 80/20 PRINCIPLE and Parkinson’s Law are the two cornerstone concepts that will be revisited in\ndifferent forms throughout this entire section. Most inputs are useless and time is wasted in proportion to\nthe amount that is available.\nFat-free performance and time freedom begins with limiting intake overload. In the next chapter, we’ll\nput you on the real breakfast of champions: the Low-Information Diet.\nLove of bustle is not industry.\n—SENECA\nA Dozen Cupcakes and One Question\nMOUNTAIN VIEW, CALIFORNIA.\n“Saturdays are my days off,” I offered to the crowd of strangers staring at me, friends of a friend. It\nwas true. Can you eat All-Bran and chicken seven days a week? Me neither. Don’t be so judgmental.\nBetween my tenth and twelfth cupcakes, I plopped down on the couch to revel in the sugar high until\nthe clock struck midnight and sent me back to my adultsville Sunday–Friday diet. There was another\nparty guest seated next to me on a chair, nursing a glass of wine, not his twelfth but certainly not his first,\nand we struck up a conversation. As usual, I had to struggle to answer “What do you do?” and, as usual,\nmy answer left someone to wonder whether I was a pathological liar or a criminal.\nHow was it possible to spend so little time on income generation? It’s a good question. It’s THE\nquestion.\nIn almost all respects, Charney had it all. He was happily married with a two-year-old son and another\ndue to arrive in three months. He was a successful technology salesman, and though he wanted to earn\n$500,000 more per year as all do, his finances were solid.\nHe also asked good questions. I had just returned from another trip overseas and was planning a new\nadventure to Japan. He drilled me for two hours with a refrain: How is it possible to spend so little time\non income generation?\n“If you’re interested, we can make you a case study and I’ll show you how,” I offered.\nCharney was in. The one thing he didn’t have was time.\nOne e-mail and five weeks of practice later, Charney had good news: He had accomplished more in\nthe last week than he had in the previous four combined. He did so while taking Monday and Friday off\nand spending at least 2 more hours per day with his family. From 40 hours per week, he was down to 18\nand producing four times the results.\nWas it from mountaintop retreats and secret kung fu training? Nope. Was it a new Japanese\nmanagement secret or better software? Nein. I just asked him to do one simple thing consistently without\nfail.\nAt least three times per day at scheduled times, he had to ask himself the following question:\nAm I being productive or just active?\nCharney captured the essence of this with less-abstract wording:\nAm I inventing things to do to avoid the important?\nHe eliminated all of the activities he used as crutches and began to focus on demonstrating results instead\nof showing dedication. Dedication is often just meaningless work in disguise. Be ruthless and cut the fat.\nIt is possible to have your cupcake and eat it, too.\nQ&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS\nWe create stress for ourselves because you feel like you have to do it. You have to. I don’t feel\nthat anymore.\n—OPRAH WINFREY, actress and talk-show host, The Oprah Winfrey Show\nThe key to having more time is doing less, and there are two paths to getting there, both of which\nshould be used together: (1) Define a to-do list and (2) define a not-to-do list. In general terms, there are\nbut two questions:\nWhat 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness?\nWhat 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcome and happiness?\nHypothetical cases help to get us started:\n1. If you had a heart attack and had to work two hours per day, what would you do?\nNot five hours, not four hours, not three—two hours. It’s not where I want you to ultimately be, but it’s a\nstart. Besides, I can hear your brain bubbling already: That’s ridiculous. Impossible! I know, I know. If I\ntold you that you could survive for months, functioning quite well, on four hours of sleep per night,\nwould you believe me? Probably not. Notwithstanding, millions of new mothers do it all the time. This\nexercise is not optional. The doctor has warned you, after triple-bypass surgery, that if you don’t cut\ndown your work to two hours per day for the first three months post-op, you will die. How would you do\nit?\n2. If you had a second heart attack and had to work two hours per week, what would you do?\n3. If you had a gun to your head and had to stop doing 4/5 of different time-consuming activities,\nwhat would you remove? Simplicity requires ruthlessness. If you had to stop\nof time-consuming\nactivities—e-mail, phone calls, conversations, paperwork, meetings, advertising, customers, suppliers,\nproducts, services, etc.—what would you eliminate to keep the negative effect on income to a minimum?\nUsed even once per month, this question alone can keep you sane and on track.\n4. What are the top-three activities that I use to fill time to feel as though I’ve been productive?\nThese are usually used to postpone more important actions (often uncomfortable because there is a\nchance of failure or rejection). Be honest with yourself, as we all do this on occasion. What are your\ncrutch activities?\n5. Who are the 20% of people who produce 80% of your enjoyment and propel you forward, and\nwhich 20% cause 80% of your depression, anger, and second-guessing?\nIdentify:\nPositive friends versus time-consuming friends: Who is helping\nversus hurting you, and how do you increase your time with the\nformer while decreasing or eliminating your time with the latter?\nWho is causing me stress disproportionate to the time I spend with\nthem? What will happen if I simply stop interacting with these\npeople? Fear-setting helps here.\nWhen do I feel starved for time? What commitments, thoughts,\nand people can I eliminate to fix this problem?\nExact numbers aren’t needed to realize that we spend too much time with those who poison us with\npessimism, sloth, and low expectations of themselves and the world. It is often the case that you have to\nfire certain friends or retire from particular social circles to have the life you want. This isn’t being\nmean; it is being practical. Poisonous people do not deserve your time. To think otherwise is masochistic.\nThe best way to approach a potential break is simple: Confide in them honestly but tactfully and\nexplain your concerns. If they bite back, your conclusions have been confirmed. Drop them like any\nother bad habit. If they promise to change, first spend at least two weeks apart to develop other positive\ninfluences in your life and diminish psychological dependency. The next trial period should have a set\nduration and consist of pass-or-fail criteria.\nIf this approach is too confrontational for you, just politely refuse to interact with them. Be in the\nmiddle of something when the call comes, and have a prior commitment when the invitation to hang out\ncomes. Once you see the benefits of decreased time with these people, it will be easier to stop\ncommunication altogether.\nI’m not going to lie: It sucks. It hurts like pulling out a splinter. But you are the average of the five\npeople you associate with most, so do not underestimate the effects of your pessimistic, unambitious, or\ndisorganized friends. If someone isn’t making you stronger, they’re making you weaker.\nRemove the splinters and you’ll thank yourself for it.\n6. Learn to ask, “If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?”\nDon’t ever arrive at the office or in front of your computer without a clear list of priorities. You’ll just\nread unassociated e-mail and scramble your brain for the day. Compile your to-do list for tomorrow no\nlater than this evening. I don’t recommend using Outlook or computerized to-do lists, because it is\npossible to add an infinite number of items. I use a standard piece of paper folded in half three times,\nwhich fits perfectly in the pocket and limits you to noting only a few items.\nThere should never be more than two mission-critical items to complete each day. Never. It just isn’t\nnecessary if they’re actually high-impact. If you are stuck trying to decide between multiple items that all\nseem crucial, as happens to all of us, look at each in turn and ask yourself, If this is the only thing I\naccomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?\nTo counter the seemingly urgent, ask yourself: What will happen if I don’t do this, and is it worth\nputting off the important to do it? If you haven’t already accomplished at least one important task in the\nday, don’t spend the last business hour returning a DVD to avoid a $5 late charge. Get the important task\ndone and pay the $5 fine.\n7. Put a Post-it on your computer screen or set an Outlook reminder to alert you at least three\ntimes daily with the question: Are you inventing things to do to avoid the important?\nI also use free time-tracking software called RescueTime (www.rescuetime.com) to alert me when I\nspend more than an allotted time on certain websites or programs often used to avoid the important\n(Gmail, Facebook, Outlook, etc.). It also summarizes your time use each week and compares your\nperformance to peers.\n8. Do not multitask.\nI’m going to tell you what you already know. Trying to brush your teeth, talk on the phone, and answer\ne-mail at the same time just doesn’t work. Eating while doing online research and instant messaging?\nDitto.\nIf you prioritize properly, there is no need to multitask. It is a symptom of “task creep”—doing more\nto feel productive while actually accomplishing less. As stated, you should have, at most, two primary\ngoals or tasks per day. Do them separately from start to finish without distraction. Divided attention will\nresult in more frequent interruptions, lapses in concentration, poorer net results, and less gratification.\n9. Use Parkinson’s Law on a Macro and Micro Level.\nUse Parkinson’s Law to accomplish more in less time. Shorten schedules and deadlines to necessitate\nfocused action instead of deliberation and procrastination.\nOn a weekly and daily macro level, attempt to take Monday and/or Friday off, as well as leave work at\n4 P.M. This will focus you to prioritize more effectively and quite possibly develop a social life. If you’re\nunder the hawklike watch of a boss, we’ll discuss the nuts and bolts of how to escape in later chapters.\nOn a micro task level, limit the number of items on your to-do list and use impossibly short deadlines\nto force immediate action while ignoring minutiae.\nIf doing work online or near an online computer, http://e.ggtimer.com/ is a convenient countdown\ntimer. Just type the desired time limit directly into the URL field and hit enter. The http:// can often be\nomitted. For example:\nhttp://e.ggtimer.com/5minutes (or just “e.ggtimer.com/5min”insomebrowsers)\nhttp://e.ggtimer.com/1hour30minutes30seconds\nhttp://e.ggtimer.com/30 (if you just put in a number, it assumes seconds)\nCOMFORT CHALLENGE\nLearn to Propose (2 Days)\nStop asking for opinions and start proposing solutions. Begin with the small things. If someone is going\nto ask, or asks, “Where should we eat?” “What movie should we watch?” “What should we do tonight?”\nor anything similar, do NOT reflect it back with, “Well, what do you want to … ?” Offer a solution. Stop\nthe back-and-forth and make a decision. Practice this in both personal and professional environments.\nHere are a few lines that help (my favorites are the first and last):\n“Can I make a suggestion?”\n“I propose …”\n“I’d like to propose …”\n“I suggest that … What do you think?”\n“Let’s try … and then try something else if that doesn’t work.”\nLIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION\nI’m a musician who got your book because Derek Sivers at CD Baby recommended it. Checking\nPareto’s Law I realized that 78% of my downloads came from just one of my CDs and that 55% of my\ntotal download income came from only five songs! It showed me what my fans are looking for and\nallowed me to showcase those on my web site. Downloads are the way to go. iTunes sells the song and\nCD Baby direct deposits it to my account. Fully automated once the recording is done. There are some\nmonths I can live off download income. Once I finish paying off debt, it should be no problem to travel\nas an artist and create new fans all over the world and have a cyber income stream.\n—VICTOR JOHNSON\nAs for “outsourcing” your banking, any company that needs to take checks (cheques) should consider\na lock box solution. Just about any bank that does business banking offers it. All checks go to a PO box\nat the bank, the bank processes the checks and deposits them, and according to your instructions can\nsend you a file of all the checks that are deposited. Normally this can be done in either a flat, Excel or\nother file type that can interface with any accounting systems from Excel, to Quicken to SAP. Quite cost\neffective.\n—ANONYMOUS\nThe Low-Information Diet\nCULTIVATING SELECTIVE IGNORANCE\nWhat information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence,\na wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention\nefficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it.\n—HERBERT SIMON, recipient of Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics 8 and the A.M. Turing\nAward, the “Nobel Prize of Computer Science”\nReading, after a certain age, diverts the mind too much from its creative pursuits. Any man who\nreads too much and uses his own brain too little falls into lazy habits of thinking.\n—ALBERT EINSTEIN\nI hope you’re sitting down. Take that sandwich out of your mouth so you don’t choke. Cover the\nbaby’s ears. I’m going to tell you something that upsets a lot of people.\nI never watch the news and have bought one single newspaper in the last five years, in Stansted\nAirport in London, and only because it gave me a discount on a Diet Pepsi.\nI would claim to be Amish, but last time I checked, Pepsi wasn’t on the menu.\nHow obscene! I call myself an informed and responsible citizen? How do I stay up-to-date with\ncurrent affairs? I’ll answer all of that, but wait—it gets better. I usually check business e-mail for about\nan hour each Monday, and I never check voicemail when abroad. Never ever.\nBut what if someone has an emergency? It doesn’t happen. My contacts now know that I don’t\nrespond to emergencies, so the emergencies somehow don’t exist or don’t come to me. Problems, as a\nrule, solve themselves or disappear if you remove yourself as an information bottleneck and empower\nothers.\nCultivating Selective Ignorance\nThere are many things of which a wise man might wish to be ignorant.\n—RALPH WALDO EMERSON (1803–1882)\nFrom this point forward, I’m going to propose that you develop an uncanny ability to be selectively\nignorant. Ignorance may be bliss, but it is also practical. It is imperative that you learn to ignore or\nredirect all information and interruptions that are irrelevant, unimportant, or unactionable. Most are all\nthree.\nThe first step is to develop and maintain a low-information diet. Just as modern man consumes both\ntoo many calories and calories of no nutritional value, information workers eat data both in excess and\nfrom the wrong sources.\nLifestyle design is based on massive action—output. Increased output necessitates decreased input.\nMost information is time-consuming, negative, irrelevant to your goals, and outside of your influence. I\nchallenge you to look at whatever you read or watched today and tell me that it wasn’t at least two of the\nfour.\nI read the front-page headlines through the newspaper machines as I walk to lunch each day and\nnothing more. In five years, I haven’t had a single problem due to this selective ignorance. It gives you\nsomething new to ask the rest of the population in lieu of small talk: “Tell me, what’s new in the\nworld?” And, if it’s that important, you’ll hear people talking about it. Using my crib notes approach to\nworld affairs, I also retain more than someone who loses the forest for the trees in a sea of extraneous\ndetails.\nFrom an actionable information standpoint, I consume a maximum of one-third of one industry\nmagazine (Response magazine) and one business magazine (Inc.) per month, for a grand total of\napproximately four hours. That’s it for results-oriented reading. I read an hour of fiction prior to bed for\nrelaxation.\nHow on earth do I act responsibly? Let me give an example of how I and other NR both consider and\nobtain information. I voted in the last presidential election, 9 despite having been in Berlin. I made my\ndecision in a matter of hours. First, I sent e-mails to educated friends in the U.S. who share my values\nand asked them who they were voting for and why. Second, I judge people based on actions and not\nwords; thus, I asked friends in Berlin, who had more perspective outside of U.S. media propaganda, how\nthey judged the candidates based on their historical behavior. Last, I watched the presidential debates.\nThat was it. I let other dependable people synthesize hundreds of hours and thousands of pages of media\nfor me. It was like having dozens of personal information assistants, and I didn’t have to pay them a\nsingle cent.\nThat’s a simple example, you say, but what if you need to learn to do something your friends haven’t\ndone? Like, say, sell a book to the world’s largest publisher as a first-time author? Funny you should\nask. There are two approaches I used:\n1. I picked one book out of dozens based on reader reviews and the fact that the authors had actually\ndone what I wanted to do. If the task is how-to in nature, I only read accounts that are “how I did it” and\nautobiographical. No speculators or wannabes are worth the time.\n2. Using the book to generate intelligent and specific questions, I contacted 10 of the top authors and\nagents in the world via e-mail and phone, with a response rate of 80%.\nI only read the sections of the book that were relevant to immediate next steps, which took less than\ntwo hours. To develop a template e-mail and call script took approximately four hours, and the actual e-\nmails and phone calls took less than an hour. This personal contact approach is not only more effective\nand more efficient than all-you-can-eat info buffets, it also provided me with the major league alliances\nand mentors necessary to sell this book. Rediscover the power of the forgotten skill called “talking.” It\nworks.\nOnce again, less is more.\nHow to Read 200% Faster in 10 Minutes\nThere will be times when, it’s true, you will have to read. Here are four simple tips that will lessen the\ndamage and increase your speed at least 200% in 10 minutes with no comprehension loss:\n1. Two Minutes: Use a pen or finger to trace under each line as you read as fast as possible.\nReading is a series of jumping snapshots (called saccades), and using a visual guide prevents\nregression.\n2. Three Minutes: Begin each line focusing on the third word in from the first word, and end\neach line focusing on the third word in from the last word. This makes use of peripheral vision\nthat is otherwise wasted on margins. For example, even when the highlighted words in the next\nline are your beginning and ending focal points, the entire sentence is “read,” just with less eye\nmovement:\n“Once upon a time, an information addict decided to detox.”\nMove in from both sides further and further as it gets easier.\n3. Two Minutes: Once comfortable indenting three or four words from both sides, attempt to\ntake only two snapshots—also known as fixations—per line on the first and last indented\nwords.\n4. Three Minutes: Practice reading too fast for comprehension but with good technique (the\nabove three techniques) for five pages prior to reading at a comfortable speed. This will\nheighten perception and reset your speed limit, much like how 50 mph normally feels fast but\nseems like slow motion if you drop down from 70 mph on the freeway.\nTo calculate reading speed in words per minute (wpm)—and thus progress—in a given book, add up\nthe number of words in ten lines and divide by ten to get the average words per line. Multiply this by the\nnumber of lines per page and you have the average words per page. Now it’s simple. If you initially read\n1.25 pages in one minute at 330 average words per page, that’s 412.5 words per minute. If you then read\n3.5 pages after training, it’s 1,155 words per minute and you’re in the top 1% of the world’s fastest\nreaders.\nQ&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS\nLearning to ignore things is one of the great paths to inner peace.\n—ROBERT J. SAWYER, Calculating God\n1. Go on an immediate one-week media fast.\nThe world doesn’t even hiccup, much less end, when you cut the information umbilical cord. To realize\nthis, it’s best to use the Band-Aid approach and do it quickly: a one-week media fast. Information is too\nmuch like ice cream to do otherwise. “Oh, I’ll just have a half a spoonful” is about as realistic as “I just\nwant to jump online for a minute.” Go cold turkey.\nIf you want to go back to the 15,000-calorie potato chip information diet afterward, fine, but beginning\ntomorrow and for at least five full days, here are the rules:\nNo newspapers, magazines, audiobooks, or nonmusic radio. Music is permitted at all times.\nNo news websites whatsoever (cnn.com, drudgereport.com, msn.com, 10 etc.).\nNo television at all, except for one hour of pleasure viewing each evening.\nNo reading books, except for this book and one hour of fiction 11 pleasure reading prior to bed.\nNo web surfing at the desk unless it is necessary to complete a work task for that day. Necessary means\nnecessary, not nice to have.\nUnnecessary reading is public enemy number one during this one-week fast.\nWhat do you do with all the extra time? Replace the newspaper at breakfast with speaking to your\nspouse, bonding with your children, or learning the principles in this book. Between 9–5, complete your\ntop priorities as per the last chapter. If you complete them with time to spare, do the exercises in this\nbook. Recommending this book might seem hypocritical, but it’s not: The information in these pages is\nboth important and to be applied now, not tomorrow or the day after.\nEach day at lunch break, and no earlier, get your five-minute news fix. Ask a well-informed colleague\nor a restaurant waiter, “Anything important happening in the world today? I couldn’t get the paper\ntoday.” Stop this as soon as you realize that the answer doesn’t affect your actions at all. Most people\nwon’t even remember what they spent one to two hours absorbing that morning.\nBe strict with yourself. I can prescribe the medicine, but you need to take it.\nDownload the Firefox web browser (www.firefox.com) and use LeechBlock to block certain sites\nentirely for set periods. From their site (http://www.proginosko.com/leechblock.html):\nYou can specify up to six sets of sites to block, with different times and days for each set. You can block\nsites within fixed time periods (e.g., between 9am and 5pm), after a time limit (e.g., 10 minutes in every\nhour), or with a combination of time periods and time limit (e.g., 10 minutes in every hour between 9am\nand 5pm). You can also set a password for access to the extension options, just to slow you down in\nmoments of weakness!\n2. Develop the habit of asking yourself, “Will I definitely use this information for something\nimmediate and important?”\nIt’s not enough to use information for “something”—it needs to be immediate and important. If “no” on\neither count, don’t consume it. Information is useless if it is not applied to something important or if you\nwill forget it before you have a chance to apply it.\nI used to have the habit of reading a book or site to prepare for an event weeks or months in the future,\nand I would then need to reread the same material when the deadline for action was closer. This is stupid\nand redundant. Follow your to-do short list and fill in the information gaps as you go.\nFocus on what digerati Kathy Sierra calls “just-in-time” information instead of “just-in-case”\ninformation.\n3. Practice the art of nonfinishing.\nThis is another one that took me a long time to learn. Starting something doesn’t automatically justify\nfinishing it.\nIf you are reading an article that sucks, put it down and don’t pick it back up. If you go to a movie and\nit’s worse than Matrix III, get the hell out of there before more neurons die. If you’re full after half a\nplate of ribs, put the damn fork down and don’t order dessert.\nMore is not better, and stopping something is often 10 times better than finishing it. Develop the habit\nof nonfinishing that which is boring or unproductive if a boss isn’t demanding it.\nCOMFORT CHALLENGE\nGet Phone Numbers (2 Days)\nBeing sure to maintain eye contact, ask for the phone numbers of at least two (the more you attempt, the\nless stressful it will be) attractive members of the opposite sex on each day. Girls, this means you’re in\nthe game as well, and it doesn’t matter if you’re 50+. Remember that the real goal is not to get numbers,\nbut to get over the fear of asking, so the outcome is unimportant. If you’re in a relationship, sign up to\n(or pretend to) gather information for Greenpeace. Just toss the numbers if you get them.\nGo to a mall if you want to get some rapid-fire practice—my preference for getting over the\ndiscomfort quickly—and aim to ask three people in a row within five minutes. Feel free to use some\nvariation of the following script:\n“Excuse me. I know this is going to sound strange, but if I don’t ask you now, I’ll be kicking myself\nfor the rest of the day. I’m running to meet a friend [i.e., I have friends and am not a stalker], but I think\nyou’re really [extremely, drop-dead] cute [gorgeous, hot]. Could I have your phone number? I’m not a\npsycho—I promise. You can give me a fake one if you’re not interested.”\n8. Simon received the Nobel Prize in 1978 for his contribution to organizational decision making: It is\nimpossible to have perfect and complete information at any given time to make a decision.\n9. 2004 at the time this was written.\n10. LOL.\n11. As someone who read exclusively nonfiction for nearly 15 years, I can tell you two things: It’s not\nproductive to read two fact-based books at the same time (this is one), and fiction is better than\nsleeping pills for putting the happenings of the day behind you.\nInterrupting Interruption and the\nArt of Refusal\nDo your own thinking independently. Be the chess player, not the chess piece.\n—RALPH CHARELL\nMeetings are an addictive, highly self-indulgent activity that corporations and other\norganizations habitually engage in only because they cannot actually masturbate.\n—DAVE BARRY, Pulitzer Prize–winning American humorist\nSPRING 2000, PRINCETON , NEW JERSEY\n1:35 P.M.\n“I think I understand. Moving on. In the next paragraph, it explains that …” I had detailed notes and\ndidn’t want to miss a single point.\n3:45 P.M.\n“OK. That makes sense, but if we look at the following example …” I paused for a moment midsentence.\nThe teaching assistant had both hands on his face.\n“Tim, let’s end here for now. I’ll be sure to keep these points in mind.” He had had enough. Me too,\nbut I knew I’d only have to do it once.\nFor all four years of school, I had a policy. If I received anything less than an A on the first paper or\nnon-multiple-choice test in a given class, I would bring 2–3 hours of questions to the grader’s office\nhours and not leave until the other had answered them all or stopped out of exhaustion.\nThis served two important purposes:\n1. I learned exactly how the grader evaluated work, including his or her prejudices and pet peeves.\n2. The grader would think long and hard about ever giving me less than an A. He or she would never\nconsider giving me a bad grade without exceptional reasons for doing so, as he or she knew I’d\ncome a’knocking for another three-hour visit.\nLearn to be difficult when it counts. In school as in life, having a reputation for being assertive will\nhelp you receive preferential treatment without having to beg or fight for it every time.\nThink back to your days on the playground. There was always a big bully and countless victims, but\nthere was also that one small kid who fought like hell, thrashing and swinging for the fences. He or she\nmight not have won, but after one or two exhausting exchanges, the bully chose not to bother him or her.\nIt was easier to find someone else.\nBe that kid.\nDoing the important and ignoring the trivial is hard because so much of the world seems to conspire to\nforce crap upon you. Fortunately, a few simple routine changes make bothering you much more painful\nthan leaving you in peace.\nIt’s time to stop taking information abuse.\nNot All Evils Are Created Equal\nFor our purposes, an interruption is anything that prevents the start-to-finish completion of a critical\ntask, and there are three principal offenders:\n1. Time wasters: those things that can be ignored with little or no consequence. Common time\nwasters include meetings, discussions, phone calls, web surfing, and e-mail that are unimportant.\n2. Time consumers: repetitive tasks or requests that need to be completed but often interrupt highlevel\nwork. Here are a few you might know intimately: reading and responding to e-mail, making\nand returning phone calls, customer service (order status, product assistance, etc.), financial or\nsales reporting, personal errands, all necessary repeated actions and tasks.\n3. Empowerment failures: instances where someone needs approval to make something small\nhappen. Here are just a few: fixing customer problems (lost shipments, damaged shipments,\nmalfunctions, etc.), customer contact, cash expenditures of all types.\nLet’s look at the prescriptions for all three in turn.\nTime Wasters: Become an Ignoramus\nThe best defense is a good offense.\n—DAN GABLE, Olympic gold medalist in wrestling and the most successful coach in history;\npersonal record: 299–6–3, with 182 pins\nTime wasters are the easiest to eliminate and deflect. It is a matter of limiting access and funneling all\ncommunication toward immediate action.\nFirst, limit e-mail consumption and production. This is the greatest single interruption in the modern\nworld.\n1. Turn off the audible alert if you have one on Outlook or a similar program and turn off\nautomatic send/receive, which delivers e-mail to your inbox as soon as someone sends them.\n2. Check e-mail twice per day, once at 12:00 noon or just prior to lunch, and again at 4:00 P.M.\n12:00 P.M. and 4:00 P.M. are times that ensure you will have the most responses from previously\nsent e-mail. Never check e-mail first thing in the morning. 12 Instead, complete your most\nimportant task before 11:00 A.M. to avoid using lunch or reading e-mail as a postponement excuse.\nLIGHT GRAY INDICATES TIME AVAILABLE FOR HIGH-PRIORITY TASKS . Courtesy of SANDIA\nBefore implementing the twice-daily routine, you must create an e-mail autoresponse that will train\nyour boss, co-workers, suppliers, and clients to be more effective. I would recommend that you do not\nask to implement this. Remember one of our ten commandments: Beg for forgiveness; don’t ask for\npermission.\nIf this gives you heart palpitations, speak with your immediate supervisor and propose to trial the\napproach for one to three days. Cite pending projects and frustration with constant interruptions as the\nreasons. Feel free to blame it on spam or someone outside of the office.\nHere is a simple e-mail template that can be used:\nGreetings, Friends [or Esteemed Colleagues],\nDue to high workload, I am currently checking and responding to e-mail twice daily at 12:00 p.m.\nET [or your time zone] and 4:00 p.m. ET.\nIf you require urgent assistance (please ensure it is urgent) that cannot wait until either 12:00 p.m.\nor 4:00 p.m., please contact me via phone at 555–555–5555.\nThank you for understanding this move to more efficiency and effectiveness. It helps me\naccomplish more to serve you better.\nSincerely,\nTim Ferriss\nMOVE TO ONCE-PER-DAY as quickly as possible. Emergencies are seldom that. People are poor judges of\nimportance and inflate minutiae to fill time and feel important. This autoresponse is a tool that, far from\ndecreasing collective effectiveness, forces people to re-evaluate their reason for interrupting you and\nhelps them decrease meaningless and time-consuming contact.\nI was initially terrified of missing important requests and inviting disaster, just as you might be upon\nreading this recommendation. Nothing happened. Give it a shot and work out the small bumps as you\nprogress.\nFor an extreme example of a personal autoresponder that has never prompted a complaint and allowed\nme to check e-mail once per week, send an e-mail to template@fourhourworkweek.com. It has been\nrevised over three years and works like a charm.\nThe second step is to screen incoming and limit outgoing phone calls.\n1. Use two telephone numbers if possible—one office line (non urgent) and one cellular (urgent). This\ncould also be two cell phones, or the non-urgent line could be an Internet phone number that routes calls\nto online voicemail (www.skype.com, for example).\nUse the cell number in the e-mail autoresponse and answer it at all times unless it is an unknown caller\nor it is a call you don’t want to answer. If in doubt, allow the call to go to voicemail and listen to the\nvoicemail immediately afterward to gauge importance. If it can wait, let it wait. The offending parties\nhave to learn to wait.\nThe office phone should be put on silent mode and allowed to go to voicemail at all times. The\nvoicemail recording should sound familiar:\nYou’ve reached the desk of Tim Ferriss.\nI am currently checking and responding to voicemail twice daily at 12:00 p.m. ET [or your time\nzone] and 4:00 p.m. ET.\nIf you require assistance with a truly urgent matter that cannot wait until either 12:00 p.m. or 4:00\np.m., please contact me on my cell at 555–555–5555. Otherwise, please leave a message and I will\nreturn it at the next of those two times. Be sure to leave your e-mail address, as I am often able to\nrespond faster that way.\nThank you for understanding this move to more efficiency and effectiveness. It helps me\naccomplish more to serve you better.\nHave a wonderful day.\n2. If someone does call your cell phone, it is presumably urgent and should be treated as such. Do not\nallow them to consume time otherwise. It’s all in the greeting. Compare the following:\nJane (receiver):Hello?\nJohn (caller): Hi, is this Jane?\nJane: This is Jane.\nJohn: Hi, Jane, it’s John.\nJane: Oh, hi, John. How are you? (or) Oh, hi, John. What’s going on?\nJohn will now digress and lead you into a conversation about nothing, from which you will have to\nrecover and then fish out the ultimate purpose of the call. There is a better approach:\nJane: This is Jane speaking.\nJohn: Hi, it’s John.\nJane: Hi, John. I’m right in the middle of something. How can I help you out?\nPotential continuation:\nJohn: Oh, I can call back.\nJane: No, I have a minute. What can I do for you?\nDon’t encourage people to chitchat and don’t let them chitchat. Get them to the point immediately. If\nthey meander or try to postpone for a later undefined call, reel them in and get them to come to the point.\nIf they go into a long description of a problem, cut in with, “[Name], sorry to interrupt, but I have a call\nin five minutes. What can I do to help out?” You might instead say, “[Name], sorry to interrupt, but I\nhave a call in five minutes. Can you send me an e-mail?”\nThe third step is to master the art of refusal and avoiding meetings.\nTHE FIRST DAY our new Sales VP arrived at TrueSAN in 2001, he came into the all-company meeting\nand made an announcement in just about this many words: “I am not here to make friends. I have been\nhired to build a sales team and sell product, and that’s what I intend to do. Thanks.” So much for small\ntalk.\nHe proceeded to deliver on his promise. The office socializers disliked him for his no-nonsense\napproach to communication, but everyone respected his time. He wasn’t rude without reason, but he was\ndirect and kept the people around him focused. Some didn’t consider him charismatic, but no one\nconsidered him anything less than spectacularly effective.\nI remember sitting down in his office for our first one-on-one meeting. Fresh off four years of\nrigorous academic training, I immediately jumped into explaining the prospect profiles, elaborate\nplanning I’d developed, responses to date, and so forth and so on. I had spent at least two hours\npreparing to make this first impression a good one. He listened with a smile on his face for no more than\ntwo minutes and then held up a hand. I stopped. He laughed in a kind-hearted manner and said, “Tim, I\ndon’t want the story. Just tell me what we need to do.”\nOver the following weeks, he trained me to recognize when I was unfocused or focused on the wrong\nthings, which meant anything that didn’t move the top two or three clients one step closer to signing a\npurchase order. Our meetings were now no more than five minutes long.\nFrom this moment forward, resolve to keep those around you focused and avoid all meetings, whether\nin person or remote, that do not have clear objectives. It is possible to do this tactfully, but expect that\nsome time wasters will be offended the first few times their advances are rejected. Once it is clear that\nremaining on task is your policy and not subject to change, they will accept it and move on with life.\nHard feelings pass. Don’t suffer fools or you’ll become one.\nIt is your job to train those around you to be effective and efficient. No one else will do it for you.\nHere are a few recommendations:\n1. Decide that, given the non-urgent nature of most issues, you will steer people toward the following\nmeans of communication, in order of preference: e-mail, phone, and in-person meetings. If someone\nproposes a meeting, request an e-mail instead and then use the phone as your fallback offer if need be.\nCite other immediately pending work tasks as the reason.\n2. Respond to voicemail via e-mail whenever possible. This trains people to be concise. Help them\ndevelop the habit.\nSimilar to our opening greeting on the phone, e-mail communication should be streamlined to prevent\nneedless back-and-forth. Thus, an e-mail with “Can you meet at 4:00 P.M.?” would become “Can you\nmeet at 4:00 P.M.? If so If not, please advise three other times that work for you.”\nThis “if … then” structure becomes more important as you check e-mail less often. Since I only check\ne-mail once a week, it is critical that no one needs a “what if?” answered or other information within\nseven days of a given e-mail I send. If I suspect that a manufacturing order hasn’t arrived at the shipping\nfacility, for example, I’ll send an e-mail to my shipping facility manager along these lines: “Dear Susan\n… Has the new manufacturing shipment arrived? If so, please advise me on … If not, please contact John\nDoe at 555–5555 or via e-mail at john@doe.com (he is also CC’d) and advise on delivery date and\ntracking. John, if there are any issues with the shipment, please coordinate with Susan, reachable at 555–\n4444, who has the authority to make decisions up to $500 on my behalf. In case of emergency, call me\non my cell phone, but I trust you two. Thanks.” This prevents most follow-up questions, avoids two\nseparate dialogues, and takes me out of the problem-solving equation.\nGet into the habit of considering what “if … then” actions can be proposed in any e-mail where you\nask a question.\n3. Meetings should only be held to make decisions about a predefined situation, not to define the\nproblem. If someone proposes that you meet with them or “set a time to talk on the phone,” ask that\nperson to send you an e-mail with an agenda to define the purpose:\nThat sounds doable. So I can best prepare, can you please send me an e-mail with an agenda? That is,\nthe topics and questions we’ll need to address? That would be great. Thanks in advance.\nDon’t give them a chance to bail out. The “thanks in advance” before a retort increases your chances\nof getting the e-mail.\nThe e-mail medium forces people to define the desired outcome of a meeting or call. Nine times out\nof ten, a meeting is unnecessary and you can answer the questions, once defined, via e-mail. Impose this\nhabit on others. I haven’t had an in-person meeting for my business in more than five years and have had\nfewer than a dozen conference calls, all lasting less than 30 minutes.\n4. Speaking of 30 minutes, if you absolutely cannot stop a meeting or call from happening, define the end\ntime. Do not leave these discussions open-ended, and keep them short. If things are well-defined,\ndecisions should not take more than 30 minutes. Cite other commitments at odd times to make them more\nbelievable (e.g., 3:20 vs. 3:30) and force people to focus instead of socializing, commiserating, and\ndigressing. If you must join a meeting that is scheduled to last a long time or that is open-ended, inform\nthe organizer that you would like permission to cover your portion first, as you have a commitment in 15\nminutes. If you have to, feign an urgent phone call. Get the hell out of there and have someone else\nupdate you later. The other option is to be completely transparent and voice your opinion of how\nunnecessary the meeting is. If you choose this route, be prepared to face fire and offer alternatives.\n5. The cubicle is your temple—don’t permit casual visitors. Some suggest using a clear “do not disturb”\nsign of some type, but I have found that this is ignored unless you have an office. My approach was to\nput headphones on, even if I wasn’t listening to anything. If someone approached me despite this\ndiscouragement, I would pretend to be on the phone. I’d put a finger to my lips, say something like, “I\nhear you,” and then say into the mic, “Can you hold on a second?” Next, I’d turn to the invader and say,\n“Hi. What can I do for you?” I wouldn’t let them “get back to me” but rather force the person to give me\na five-second summary and then send me an e-mail if necessary.\nIf headphone games aren’t your thing, the reflexive response to an invader should be the same as when\nanswering the cell phone: “Hi, invader. I’m right in the middle of something. How can I be of help?” If\nit’s not clear within 30 seconds, ask the person to send you an e-mail about the chosen issue; do not offer\nto send them an e-mail first: “I’ll be happy to help, but I have to finish this first. Can you send me a\nquick e-mail to remind me?” If you still cannot deflect an invader, give the person a time limit on your\navailability, which can also be used for phone conversations: “OK, I only have two minutes before a call,\nbut what’s the situation and what can I do to help?”\n6. Use the Puppy Dog Close to help your superiors and others develop the no-meeting habit. The Puppy\nDog Close in sales is so named because it is based on the pet store sales approach: If someone likes a\npuppy but is hesitant to make the life-altering purchase, just offer to let them take the pup home and\nbring it back if they change their minds. Of course, the return seldom happens.\nThe Puppy Dog Close is invaluable whenever you face resistance to permanent changes. Get your foot\nin the door with a “let’s just try it once” reversible trial.\nCompare the following:\n“I think you’d love this puppy. It will forever add to your responsibilities until he dies 10 years from\nnow. No more care-free vacations, and you’ll finally get to pick up poop all over the city—what do\nyou think?”\nvs.\nNow imagine walking up to your boss in the hallway and clapping a hand on her shoulder:\n“I’d like to go to the meeting, but I have a better idea. Let’s never have another one, since all we do is\nwaste time and not decide anything useful.”\nvs.\nThe second set of alternatives seem less permanent, and they’re intended to appear so. Repeat this\nroutine and ensure that you achieve more outside of the meeting than the attendees do within it; repeat\nthe disappearing act as often as possible and cite improved productivity to convert this slowly into a\npermanent routine change.\nLearn to imitate any good child: “Just this once! Please!!! I promise I’ll do X!” Parents fall for it\nbecause kids help adults to fool themselves. It works with bosses, suppliers, customers, and the rest of\nthe world, too.\nUse it, but don’t fall for it. If a boss asks for overtime “just this once,” he or she will expect it in the\nfuture.\nTime Consumers: Batch and Do Not Falter\nA schedule defends from chaos and whim.\n—ANNIE DILLARD, winner of Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction, 1975\nIf you have never used a commercial printer before, the pricing and lead times could surprise you.\nLet’s assume it costs $310 and takes one week to print 20 customized T-shirts with 4-color logos. How\nmuch and how long does it take to print 3 of the same T-shirt?\n$310 and one week.\nHow is that possible? Simple—the setup charges don’t change. It costs the printer the same amount in\nmaterials for plate preparation ($150) and the same in labor to man the press itself ($100). The setup is\nthe real time-consumer, and thus the job, despite its small size, needs to be scheduled just like the other,\nresulting in the same one-week delivery date. The lower economy of scale picks up the rest: The cost for\n3 shirts is $20 per shirt x 3 shirts instead of $3 per shirt x 20 shirts.\nThe cost- and time-effective solution, therefore, is to wait until you have a larger order, an approach\ncalled “batching.” Batching is also the solution to our distracting but necessary time consumers, those\nrepetitive tasks that interrupt the most important.\nIf you check mail and make bill payments five times a week, it might take 30 minutes per instance and\nyou respond to a total of 20 letters in two and a half hours. If you do this once per week instead, it might\ntake 60 minutes total and you still respond to a total of 20 letters. People do the former out of fear of\nemergencies. First, there are seldom real emergencies. Second, of the urgent communication you will\nreceive, missing a deadline is usually reversible and otherwise costs a minimum to correct.\nThere is an inescapable setup time for all tasks, large or minuscule in scale. It is often the same for one\nas it is for a hundred. There is a psychological switching of gears that can require up to 45 minutes to\nresume a major task that has been interrupted. More than a quarter of each 9–5 period (28%) is\nconsumed by such interruptions. 13\nThis is true of all recurring tasks and is precisely why we have already decided to check e-mail and\nphone calls twice per day at specific predetermined times (between which we let them accumulate).\nFrom mid-2004 to 2007, I checked mail no more than once a week, often not for up to four weeks at a\ntime. Nothing was irreparable, and nothing cost more than $300 to fix. This batching has saved me\nhundreds of hours of redundant work. How much is your time worth?\nLet’s use a hypothetical example:\n1. $20 per hour is how much you are paid or value your time. This would be the case, for example, if you\nare paid $40,000 per year and get two weeks of vacation per year ($40,000 divided by [40 hours per\nweek x 50 = 2,000] = $20/hour). Estimate your hourly income by cutting the last three zeroes off of your\nannual income and halving the remaining number (e.g., $50,000/year p $25/hour.\n2. Estimate the amount of time you will save by grouping similar tasks together and batching them, and\ncalculate how much you have earned by multiplying this hour number by your per-hour rate ($20 here):\n3. Test each of the above batching frequencies and determine how much problems cost to fix in each\nperiod. If the cost is less than the above dollar amounts, batch even further apart.\nFor example, using our above math, if I check e-mail once per week and that results in an average loss\nof two sales per week, totaling $80 in lost profit, I will continue checking once per week because $200\n(10 hours of time) minus $80 is still a $120 net gain, not to mention the enormous benefits of completing\nother main tasks in those 10 hours. If you calculate the financial and emotional benefit of completing just\none main task (such as landing a major client or completing a life-changing trip), the value of batching is\nmuch more than the per-hour savings.\nIf the problems cost more than hours saved, scale back to the next-less-frequent batch schedule. In this\ncase, I would drop from once per week to twice per week (not daily) and attempt to fix the system so that\nI can return to once per week. Do not work harder when the solution is working smarter. I have batched\nboth personal and business tasks further and further apart as I’ve realized just how few real problems\ncome up. Some of my scheduled batches in 2007 were e-mail (Mondays 10:00 A.M.), phone (completely\neliminated), laundry (every other Sunday at 10:00 P.M.), credit cards and bills (most are on automatic\npayment, but I check balances every second Monday after e-mail), strength training (every 4th day for\n30 minutes), etc.\nEmpowerment Failure: Rules and Readjustment\nThe vision is really about empowering workers, giving them all the information about what’s\ngoing on so they can do a lot more than they’ve done in the past.\n—BILL GATES, cofounder of Microsoft, richest man in the world\nEmpowerment failure refers to being unable to accomplish a task without first obtaining permission or\ninformation. It is often a case of being micromanaged or micromanaging someone else, both of which\nconsume your time.\nFor the employee, the goal is to have full access to necessary information and as much independent\ndecision-making ability as possible. For the entrepreneur, the goal is to grant as much information and\nindependent decision-making ability to employees or contractors as possible.\nCustomer service is often the epitome of empowerment failure, and a personal example from\nBrainQUICKEN illustrates just how serious but easily solved the problem can be.\nIn 2002, I had outsourced customer service for order tracking and returns but still handled product-\nrelated questions myself. The result? I received more than 200 e-mail per day, spending all hours\nbetween 9–5 responding to them, and the volume was growing at a rate of more than 10% per week! I\nhad to cancel advertising and limit shipments, as additional customer service would have been the final\nnail in the coffin. It wasn’t a scalable model. Remember this word, as it will be important later. It wasn’t\nscalable because there was an information and decision bottleneck: me.\nThe clincher? The bulk of the e-mail that landed in my inbox was not product-related at all but\nrequests from the outsourced customer service reps seeking permission for different actions:\nThe customer claims he didn’t receive the shipment. What should we do?\nThe customer had a bottle held at customs. Can we reship to a U.S. address?\nThe customer needs the product for a competition in two days. Can we ship overnight, and if so, how\nmuch should we charge?\nIt was endless. Hundreds upon hundreds of different situations made it impractical to write a manual, and\nI didn’t have the time or experience to do so regardless.\nFortunately, someone did have the experience: the outsourced reps themselves. I sent one single e-\nmail to all the supervisors that immediately turned 200 e-mail per day into fewer than 20 e-mail per\nweek:\nHi All,\nI would like to establish a new policy for my account that overrides all others.\nKeep the customer happy. If it is a problem that takes less than $100 to fix, use your\njudgment and fix it yourself.\nThis is official written permission and a request to fix all problems that cost under $100\nwithout contacting me. I am no longer your customer; my customers are your customer. Don’t\nask me for permission. Do what you think is right, and we’ll make adjustments as we go along.\nThank you,\nTim\nUpon close analysis, it became clear that more than 90% of the issues that prompted e-mail could be\nresolved for less than $20. I reviewed the financial results of their independent decision-making on a\nweekly basis for four weeks, then a monthly basis, and then on a quarterly basis.\nIt’s amazing how someone’s IQ seems to double as soon as you give them responsibility and indicate\nthat you trust them. The first month cost perhaps $200 more than if I had been micromanaging. In the\nmeantime, I saved more than 100 hours of my own time per month, customers received faster service,\nreturns dropped to less than 3% (the industry average is 10–15%), and outsourcers spent less time on my\naccount, all of which resulted in rapid growth, higher profit margins, and happier people on all sides.\nPeople are smarter than you think. Give them a chance to prove themselves.\nIf you are a micromanaged employee, have a heart-to-heart with your boss and explain that you want\nto be more productive and interrupt him or her less. “I hate that I have to interrupt you so much and pull\nyou away from more important things I know you have on your plate. I was doing some reading and had\nsome thoughts on how I might be more productive. Do you have a second?”\nBefore this conversation, develop a number of “rules” like the previous example that would allow you\nto work more autonomously with less approval-seeking. The boss can review the outcome of your\ndecisions on a daily or weekly basis in the initial stages. Suggest a one-week trial and end with “I’d like\nto try it. Does that sound like something we could try for a week?” or my personal favorite, “Is that\nreasonable?” It’s hard for people to label things unreasonable.\nRealize that bosses are supervisors, not slave masters. Establish yourself as a consistent challenger of\nthe status quo and most people will learn to avoid challenging you, particularly if it is in the interest of\nhigher per-hour productivity.\nIf you are a micromanaging entrepreneur, realize that even if you can do something better than the rest\nof the world, it doesn’t mean that’s what you should be doing if it’s part of the minutiae. Empower\nothers to act without interrupting you.\nSET THE RULES in your favor: Limit access to your time, force people to define their requests before\nspending time with them, and batch routine menial tasks to prevent postponement of more important\nprojects. Do not let people interrupt you. Find your focus and you’ll find your lifestyle.\nThe bottom line is that you only have the rights you fight for.\nIn the next section, Automation, we’ll see how the New Rich create management-free money and\neliminate the largest remaining obstacle of all: themselves.\nQ&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS\nPeople think it must be fun to be a super genius, but they don’t realize how hard it is to put up\nwith all the idiots in the world.\n—CALVIN, from Calvin and Hobbes\nBlaming idiots for interruptions is like blaming clowns for scaring children—they can’t help it. It’s\ntheir nature. Then again, I had (who am I kidding—and have), on occasion, been known to create\ninterruptions out of thin air. If you’re anything like me, that makes us both occasional idiots. Learn to\nrecognize and fight the interruption impulse.\nThis is infinitely easier when you have a set of rules, responses, and routines to follow. It is your job\nto prevent yourself and others from letting the unnecessary and unimportant prevent the start-to-finish\ncompletion of the important.\nThis chapter differs from the previous in that the necessary actions, due to the inclusion of examples\nand templates, have been presented throughout from start to finish. This Q & A will thus be a summary\nrather than a repetition. The devil is in the details, so be sure to reread this chapter for the specifics.\nThe 50,000-foot review is as follows:\n1. Create systems to limit your availability via e-mail and phone and deflect inappropriate contact.\nGet the autoresponse and voicemail script in place now, and master the various methods of evasion.\nReplace the habit of “How are you?” with “How can I help you?” Get specific and remember—no\nstories. Focus on immediate actions. Set and practice interruption-killing policies.\nAvoid meetings whenever possible:\nUse e-mail instead of face-to-face meetings to solve problems.\nBeg-off going (this can be accomplished through the Puppy Dog\nClose).\nIf meetings are unavoidable, keep the following in mind:\nGo in with a clear set of objectives.\nSet an end time or leave early.\n2. Batch activities to limit setup cost and provide more time for dreamline milestones.\nWhat can I routinize by batching? That is, what tasks (whether laundry, groceries, mail, payments, or\nsales reporting, for example) can I allot to a specific time each day, week, month, quarter, or year so that\nI don’t squander time repeating them more often than is absolutely necessary?\n3. Set or request autonomous rules and guidelines with occasional review of results.\nEliminate the decision bottleneck for all things that are nonfatal if misperformed. If an employee, believe\nin yourself enough to ask for more independence on a trial basis. Have practical “rules” prepared and ask\nthe boss for the sale after surprising him or her with an impromptu presentation. Remember the Puppy\nDog Close—make it a one-time trial and reversible.\nFor the entrepreneur or manager, give others the chance to prove themselves. The likelihood of\nirreversible or expensive problems is minimal and the time savings are guaranteed. Remember, profit is\nonly profitable to the extent that you can use it. For that you need time.\nTOOLS AND TRICKS\nEliminating Paper Distractions, Capturing Everything\nEvernote ( www.evernote.com )\nThis is perhaps the most impressive tool I’ve found in the last year, introduced to me by some of the\nmost productive technologists in the world. Evernote has eliminated more than 90% of the paper in my\nlife and eliminated nearly all of the multiple tabs I used to leave open in web browsers, both of which\ndistracted me to no end. It can clear out your entire office clutter in one to three hours.\nEvernote allows you to easily capture information from anywhere using whatever device is at hand,\nand everything is then searchable (read: findable) from anywhere. I use it to:\nTake photographs of everything I might want to remember or find\nlater—business cards, handwritten notes, wine labels, receipts,\nwhiteboard sessions, and more. Evernote identifies the text in all\nof these pictures automatically, so it’s all searchable(!), whether\nfrom an iPhone, your laptop, or the web. Just as one example, I\ncan store and find the contact information from any business card\nin seconds (often using the built in iSight camera on Mac to\ncapture it), rather than spending hours inputting it all into contacts\nor searching through e-mail for that lost phone number. It’s mindnumbing\nhow much time this saves.\nScan all agreements, paper articles, etc., that would otherwise sit\nin file folders or on my desk. I use the Mac Fujitsu ScanSnap\nminiscanner ( http://bit.ly/scansnapmac ), the best I’ve found,\nwhich scans all of it directly to Evernote in seconds with one\nbutton.\nTake snapshots of websites, capturing all text and links, so that I\ncan read them offline when traveling or doing later research. Get\nrid of all those scattered bookmarks, favorites, and open tabs.\nScreening and Avoiding Unwanted Calls\nGrandCentral (www.grandcentral.com) and YouMail (www.youmail.com)\nIn a world where your physical address will change more often than your cell phone number (and e-\nmail), it can be disastrous if your number becomes public or gets in the wrong hands. Enter\nGrandCentral, which will give you a number with the area code of your choosing that then forwards to\nyour own phone(s). I now give a GrandCentral number to anyone besides family and close friends. Some\nof the benefits:\nIdentify any incoming number as unwanted, and that caller will\nthen hear a “number not in service” message when attempting to\ncall you.\nCustomize your voicemail message to individual callers (spouse,\nboss, colleague, client, etc.) and listen in on messages as they’re\nbeing left, so you can “pick up” if the message is worth the\ninterruption. Call recording is also an option.\nUse an area code outside of your hometown to prevent people and\ncompanies from finding and misusing addresses you’d prefer to\nkeep private.\nEstablish do-not-disturb hours, when calls are routed directly to\nvoicemail with no ring.\nHave voicemail sent to your cell phone as SMS (text messages).\nYouMail, another option, can also transcribe voicemails and send them to your phone as text\nmessages. Getting calls while stuck in a time-wasting meeting? No problem: Respond to voicemails via\nSMS during the meeting so you’re not stuck returning calls afterward.\nOne Shot, One Kill Scheduling Without E-mail Back-and-Forth\nFew things are as time-consuming as scheduling via e-mail. Person A: “How about Tues. at 3 P.M.?”\nPerson B: “I can make it.” Person C: “I have a meeting. How about Thurs.?” Person D: “I’m on a concall.\nHow about 10 A.M. on Fri.?” Use these tools to make scheduling simple and fast instead of another\npart-time job.\nDoodle ( www.doodle.com )\nThe best free tool I’ve found for herding cats (multiple people) for scheduling without excessive e-mail.\nCreate and poll in 30 seconds with the proposed options and forward a link to everyone invited. Check\nback a few hours later and you’ll have the best time for the most people.\nTimeDriver ( www.timedriver.com )\nLet colleagues and clients self-schedule with you based on your availability, which is determined by\nintegration with Outlook or Google Calendar. Embed a “schedule now” button in e-mail messages and\nyou’ll never have to tell people when you can make a call or meeting. Let them see what’s open and\nchoose.\nChoosing the Best E-mail Batching Times\nXobni ( www.xobni.com/special )\nXobni—inbox spelled backwards—is a free program for putting Outlook on steroids. It offers many\nfeatures, but the most relevant to this chapter is its ability to identify “hotspots,” or periods of time when\nyou receive the bulk of e-mail from your most important contacts. These “hotspots” are batching times\nthat will enable you to keep critical contacts (clients, bosses, etc.) smiling even while you reduce\nchecking e-mail to 1–3 times per day. It will also populate your contacts automatically by pulling phone\nnumbers, addresses, etc., from separate e-mail buried in the inbox.\nE-mailing Without Entering the Black Hole of the Inbox\nDon’t enter the black hole of the inbox off hours because you’re afraid you’ll forget something. Use\nthese services instead to keep focused, whether on completing a critical project or simply enjoying the\nweekend.\nJott ( www.jott.com )\nCapture thoughts, create to-do’s, and set reminders with a simple toll-free phone call. The service\ntranscribes your message (15–30 seconds) and e-mails it to whomever you want, including yourself, or\nto your Google calendar for automatic scheduling. Jott also enables you to post voice message links to\nTwitter (www.twitter.com), Facebook (www.facebook.com), and other services that tend to consume\nhours if you visit the sites themselves.\nCopy talk ( www.copytalk.com )\nDictate any message up to four minutes and have the transcription e-mailed to you within hours.\nExcellent for brainstorming, and the accuracy is astounding.\nPreventing Web Browsing Completely\nFreedom ( http://www.ibiblio.org/fred/freedom/ )\nFreedom is a free application that disables networking on an Apple computer for 1–480 mintues (up to\neight hours) at a time. Freedom will free you from the distractions of the Internet, allowing you the focus\nto get real work done.\nFreedom enforces freedom; a reboot is the only method for turning Freedom off before the time limit\nyou’ve set for yourself. The hassle of rebooting means you’re less likely to cheat, and you’ll be more\nproductive. Experiment with the software for short periods of time at first (30–60 minutes.)\nCOMFORT CHALLENGE\nRevisit the Terrible Twos (2 Days)\nFor the next two days, do as all good two-year-olds do and say “no” to all requests. Don’t be selective.\nRefuse to do all things that won’t get you immediately fired. Be selfish. As with the last exercise, the\nobjective isn’t an outcome—in this case, eliminating just those things that waste time—but the process:\ngetting comfortable with saying “no.” Potential questions to decline include the following:\nDo you have a minute?\nWant to see a movie tonight/tomorrow?\nCan you help me with X?\n“No” should be your default answer to all requests. Don’t make up elaborate lies or you’ll get called\non them. A simple “I really can’t—sorry; I’ve got too much on my plate right now” will do as a catch-all\nresponse.\nLIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION\nBatching tool—PO Box: This might be stating the obvious, but one easy way to encourage batching of\nyour mail is to use a PO Box versus getting mail delivered to your house. We got our PO Box to limit\naccess to our physical address online, but it also encourages you to get the mail less and deal with it in\nbatch. Our post office has recycling bins, so at least 60% of the mail doesn’t even come home with us.\nFor a while I was only getting and managing the mail once a week, and I found not only did it take less\ntime overall, I did a better job managing it and getting it out of the way versus looking at it and setting it\naside for future follow up.\n—LAURA TURNER\nFor families, the four-hour workweek doesn’t have to mean four months on a sailboat in the Caribbean\nunless that’s their dream, but even the simple ideal of having time to take a walk in the park every\nevening or spending weekends together, makes taking actions to implement this program worthwhile.\n[There are many different approaches for making this work]: Kids have to promise they won’t bother\nMommy in the evening while she works on the computer, the husband watches the kids in the evening,\nboth parents make plans once a week to have someone take care of the kids, etc. Then close with the\nhuge payoff for the family of having more time to spend with each other.\n—ADRIENNE JENKINS\nWhy not combine a mini-retirement with dentistry (or medical) geoarbitrage and finance your trip\nwith the savings? I lived in Thailand for four months and got root canal treatment and a crown for of\nthe price that it costs in Australia. There are many upmarket clinics set up for “expats” and health\ntravelers in Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Goa, etc., with English-speaking dentists. And in Europe\nmany people go to Poland or Hungary. To research, just Google “dentist” and the country and you will\ncome across practices advertising to foreigners. Talk to expats when you’re in the country or on online\nchat forums for recommendations. Now I’m in Australia I still combine my travels with annual dentist\ncheckups—and the savings often finance my airfare. Even between developed countries there are\nsignificant cost differences. For example France is far cheaper than the UK and Australia is cheaper than\nthe U.S. [Note from Tim: Learn more about the incredible world of medical tourism and geoarbitrage at\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_tourism.

It will set the stage for even\nmore incredible things to come, all of which you will do yourself.\nMy Outsourced Life\nA true account by AJ Jacobs, editor-at-large at Esquire magazine (ellipses represent passage of time\nbetween entries)\nIT BEGAN a month ago. I was midway through The World Is Flat, the bestseller by Tom Friedman. I\nlike Friedman, despite his puzzling decision to wear a mustache. His book is all about how outsourcing\nto India and China is not just for tech support and carmakers but is poised to transform every industry in\nAmerica, from law to banking to accounting.\nI don’t have a corporation; I don’t even have an up-to-date business card. I’m a writer and editor\nworking from home, usually in my boxer shorts or, if I’m feeling formal, my penguin-themed pajama\nbottoms. Then again, I think, why should Fortune 500 firms have all the fun? Why can’t I join in on the\nbiggest business trend of the new century? Why can’t I outsource my low-end tasks? Why can’t I\noutsource my life?\nThe next day I e-mail Brickwork, one of the companies Friedman mentions in his book. Brickwork—\nbased in Bangalore, India—offers “remote executive assistants,” mostly to financial firms and healthcare\ncompanies that want data processed. I explain that I’d like to hire someone to help with Esquire-related\ntasks—doing research, formatting memos, like that. The company’s CEO, Vivek Kulkarni, responds, “It\nwould be a great pleasure to be talking to a person of your stature.” Already I’m liking this. I’ve never\nhad stature before. In America, I barely command respect from a Bennigan’s maître d’, so it’s nice to\nknow that in India I have stature.\nA couple of days later, I get an e-mail from my new “remote executive assistant.”\nDear Jacobs,\nMy name is Honey K. Balani. I would be assisting you in your editorial and personal job…. I\nwould try to adapt myself as per your requirements that would lead to desired satisfaction.\nDesired satisfaction. This is great. Back when I worked at an office, I had assistants, but there was\nnever any talk of desired satisfaction. In fact, if anyone ever used the phrase “desired satisfaction,” we’d\nall end up in a solemn meeting with HR.\nI GO OUT to dinner with my friend Misha, who grew up in India, founded a software firm, and\nsubsequently became nauseatingly rich. I tell him about Operation Outsource. “You should call Your\nMan in India,” he says. Misha explains that this is a company for Indian businessmen who have moved\noverseas but who still have parents back in New Delhi or Mumbai. YMII is their overseas concierge\nservice—it buys movie tickets and cell phones and other sundries for abandoned moms.\nPerfect. This could kick my outsourcing up to a new level. I can have a nice, clean division of labor:\nHoney will take care of my business affairs, and YMII can attend to my personal life—pay my bills,\nmake vacation reservations, buy stuff online. Happily, YMII likes the idea, and just like that the support\nteam at Jacobs Inc. has doubled.\nHONEY HAS completed her first project for me: research on the person Esquire has chosen as the\nSexiest Woman Alive. I’ve been assigned to write a profile of this woman, and I really don’t want to\nhave to slog through all the heavy-breathing fan websites about her. When I open Honey’s file, I have\nthis reaction: America is f*cked. There are charts. There are section headers. There is a well-organized\nbreakdown of her pets, measurements, and favorite foods (e.g., swordfish). If all Bangalorians are like\nHoney, I pity Americans about to graduate college. They’re up against a hungry, polite, Excel-proficient\nIndian army.\nIN FACT, in the next few days, I outsource a whole mess of online errands to Asha (from the personal\nservice YMII): paying my bills, getting stuff from drugstore.com, finding my son a Tickle Me Elmo.\n(Actually, the store was out of Tickle Me Elmos, so Asha bought a Chicken Dance Elmo—good\ndecision.) I had her call Cingular to ask about my cell-phone plan. I’m just guessing, but I bet her call\nwas routed from Bangalore to New Jersey and then back to a Cingular employee in Bangalore, which\nmakes me happy for some reason.\nIT’S THE fourth morning of my new, farmed-out life, and when I flip on my computer, my e-mail\ninbox is already filled with updates from my overseas aides. It’s a strange feeling having people work for\nyou while you sleep. Strange, but great. I’m not wasting time while I drool on my pillow; things are\ngetting done.\nHONEY IS my protector. Consider this: For some reason, the Colorado Tourism Board e-mails me all\nthe time. (Most recently, they informed me about a festival in Colorado Springs featuring the world’s\nmost famous harlequin.) I request that Honey gently ask them to stop with the press releases. Here’s what\nshe sent:\nDear All,\nJacobs often receives mails from Colorado news, too often. They are definitely interesting topics.\nHowever, these topics are not suitable for “Esquire.”\nFurther, we do understand that you have taken a lot of initiatives working on these articles and\nsending it to us. We understand. Unfortunately, these articles and mails are too time consuming to be\nread.\nCurrently, these mails are not serving right purpose for both of us. Thus, we request to stop sending\nthese mails.\nWe do not mean to demean your research work by this.\nWe hope you understand too.\nThanking you,\nHoney K B\nThat is the best rejection notice in journalism history. It’s exceedingly polite, but there’s a little\nundercurrent of indignation. Honey seems almost outraged that Colorado would waste the valuable time\nof Jacobs.\nI DECIDE to test the next logical relationship: my marriage. These arguments with my wife are killing\nme—partly because Julie is a much better debater than I am. Maybe Asha can do better:\nHello Asha,\nMy wife got annoyed at me because I forgot to get cash at the automatic bank machine … I wonder\nif you could tell her that I love her, but gently remind her that she too forgets things—she has lost her\nwallet twice in the last month. And she forgot to buy nail clippers for Jasper.\nAJ\nI can’t tell you what a thrill I got from sending that note. It’s pretty hard to get much more passiveaggressive\nthan bickering with your wife via an e-mail from a subcontinent halfway around the world.\nThe next morning, Asha CC’d me on the e-mail she sent to Julie.\nJulie,\nDo understand your anger that I forgot to pick up the cash at the automatic machine. I have been\nforgetful and I am sorry about that.\nBut I guess that doesn’t change the fact that I love you so much….\nLove\nAJ\nP. S. This is Asha mailing on behalf of Mr. Jacobs.\nAs if that weren’t enough, she also sent Julie an e-card. I click on it: two teddy bears embracing, with\nthe words, “Anytime you need a hug, I’ve got one for you…. I’m sorry.”\nDamn! My outsourcers are too friggin’ nice! They kept the apology part but took out my little jabs.\nThey are trying to save me from myself. They are superegoing my id. I feel castrated.\nJulie, on the other hand, seems quite pleased: “That’s nice, sweetie. I forgive you.”\nDESPITE THREE weeks with my support team, I’m still stressed. Perhaps it’s the fault of Chicken\nDance Elmo, whom my son loves to the point of dry humping, but who is driving me slowly insane.\nWhatever the reason, I figure it’s time to conquer another frontier: outsourcing my inner life.\nFirst, I try to delegate my therapy. My plan is to give Asha a list of my neuroses and a childhood\nanecdote or two, have her talk to my shrink for 50 minutes, then relay the advice. Smart, right? My\nshrink refused. Ethics or something. Fine. Instead, I have Asha send me a meticulously researched memo\non stress relief. It had a nice Indian flavor to it, with a couple of yogic postures and some visualization.\nThis was okay, but it didn’t seem quite enough. I decided I needed to outsource my worry. For the last\nfew weeks I’ve been tearing my hair out because a business deal is taking far too long to close. I asked\nHoney if she would be interested in tearing her hair out in my stead. Just for a few minutes a day. She\nthought it was a wonderful idea. “I will worry about this every day,” she wrote. “Do not worry.”\nThe outsourcing of my neuroses was one of the most successful experiments of the month. Every time\nI started to ruminate, I’d remind myself that Honey was already on the case, and I’d relax. No joke—this\nalone was worth it.\nAt a Glance: Where You Will Be\nThe future is here. It’s just not widely distributed yet.\n—WILLIAM GIBSON, author of Neuromancer; coined term “cyberspace” in 1984\nHere is a sneak preview of full automation.\nI woke up this morning, and given that it’s Monday, I checked my e-mail for one hour after an\nexquisite Buenos Aires breakfast.\nSowmya from India had found a long-lost high school classmate of mine, and Anakool from YMII\nhad put together Excel research reports for retiree happiness and the average annual hours worked in\ndifferent fields. Interviews for this week had been set by a third Indian virtual assistant, who had also\nfound contact information for the best Kendo schools in Japan and the top salsa teachers in Cuba. In the\nnext e-mail folder, I was pleased to see that my fulfillment account manager in Tennessee, Beth, had\nresolved nearly two dozen problems in the last week—keeping our largest clients in China and South\nAfrica smiling—and had also coordinated California sales tax filing with my accountants in Michigan.\nThe taxes had been paid via my credit card on file, and a quick glance at my bank accounts confirmed\nthat Shane and the rest of the team at my credit card processor were depositing more cash than last\nmonth. All was right in the world of automation.\nIt was a beautiful sunny day, and I closed my laptop with a smile. For an all-you-can-eat buffet\nbreakfast with coffee and orange juice, I paid $4 U.S. The Indian outsourcers cost between $4–10 U.S.\nper hour. My domestic outsourcers are paid on performance or when product ships. This creates a curious\nbusiness phenomenon: Negative cash flow is impossible.\nFun things happen when you earn dollars, live on pesos, and compensate in rupees, but that’s just the\nbeginning.\nBut I’m an Employee! How Does This Help Me?\nNobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you’re a\nman, you take it.\n—MALCOLM X, Malcolm X Speaks\nGetting a remote personal assistant is a huge departure point and marks the moment that you learn\nhow to give orders and be commander instead of the commanded. It is small-scale training wheels for the\nmost critical of NR skills: remote management and communication.\nIt is time to learn how to be the boss. It isn’t time-consuming. It’s low-cost and it’s low-risk. Whether\nor not you “need” someone at this point is immaterial. It is an exercise.\nIt is also a litmus test for entrepreneurship: Can you manage (direct and chastise) other people? Given\nthe proper instruction and practice, I believe so. Most entrepreneurs fail because they jump into the deep\nend of the pool without learning to swim first. Using a virtual assistant (VA) as a simple exercise with no\ndownside, the basics of management are covered in a 2–4-week test costing between $100–400. This is\nan investment, not an expense, and the ROI is astounding. It will be repaid in a maximum of 10–14 days,\nafter which it is pure timesaving profit.\nBecoming a member of the NR is not just about working smarter. It’s about building a system to\nreplace yourself.\nThis is the first exercise.\nEven if you have no intention of becoming an entrepreneur, this is the ultimate continuation of our\n80/20 and elimination process: Preparing someone to replace you (even if it never happens) will produce\nan ultrarefined set of rules that will cut remaining fat and redundancy from your schedule. Lingering\nunimportant tasks will disappear as soon as someone else is being paid to do them.\nBut what about the cost?\nThis is a hurdle that is hard for most. If I can do it better than an assistant, why should I pay them at\nall? Because the goal is to free your time to focus on bigger and better things.\nThis chapter is a low-cost exercise to get you past this lifestyle limiter. It is absolutely necessary that\nyou realize that you can always do something more cheaply yourself. This doesn’t mean you want to\nspend your time doing it. If you spend your time, worth $20–25 per hour, doing something that someone\nelse will do for $10 per hour, it’s simply a poor use of resources. It is important to take baby steps\ntoward paying others to do work for you. Few do it, which is another reason so few people have their\nideal lifestyles.\nEven if the cost is occasionally more per hour than you currently earn, the trade is often worth it. Let’s\nassume you make $50,000 and thus $25 per hour (working from 9–5, Monday through Friday, for 50\nweeks per year). If you pay a top-notch assistant $30 per hour and he or she saves you one full 8-hour\nshift per week, your cost (subtracting what you’re being paid) is $40 to free an extra day. Would you pay\n$40 per week to work Monday to Thursday? I would, and I do. Keep in mind that this is a worst-case\ncost scenario.\nBut what if your boss freaks out?\nIt’s largely a non-issue, and prevention is better than cure. There is no ethical or legal reason for the\nboss to know if you choose non-sensitive tasks. The first option is to assign personal items. Time is time,\nand if you’re spending time on chores and errands that could be spent better elsewhere, a VA will\nimprove life and the management learning curve is similar. Second, you can delegate business tasks that\ndon’t include financial information or identify your company.\nReady to build an army of assistants? Let’s first look at the dark side of delegation. A review is in\norder to prevent abuses of power and wasteful behavior.\nDelegation Dangers: Before Getting Started\nThe first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient\noperation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient\noperation will magnify the inefficiency.\n—BILL GATES\nHave you ever been given illogical assignments, handed unimportant work, or commanded to do\nsomething in the most inefficient fashion possible? Not fun and not productive.\nNow it’s your turn to show that you know better. Delegation is to be used as a further step in\nreduction, not as an excuse to create more movement and add the unimportant. Remember—unless\nsomething is well-defined and important, no one should do it.\nEliminate before you delegate.\nNever automate something that can be eliminated, and never delegate something that can be automated\nor streamlined. Otherwise, you waste someone else’s time instead of your own, which now wastes your\nhard-earned cash. How’s that for incentive to be effective and efficient? Now you’re playing with your\nown dough. It’s something I want you to get comfortable with, and this baby step is small stakes.\nDid I mention to eliminate before you delegate?\nFor example, it is popular among executives to have assistants read e-mail. In some cases this is\nvaluable. In my case, I use spam filters, autoresponders with FAQs, and automatic forwarding to\noutsourcers to limit my e-mail obligation to 10–20 e-mail responses per week. It takes me 30 minutes per\nweek because I used systems—elimination and automation—to make it so.\nNor do I use an assistant to set meetings and conference calls because I have eliminated meetings. If I\nneed to set the odd 20-minute call for a given month, I’ll send one two-sentence e-mail and be done\nwith it.\nPrinciple number one is to refine rules and processes before adding people. Using people to leverage a\nrefined process multiplies production; using people as a solution to a poor process multiplies problems.\nThe Menu: A World of Possibilities\nI am not interested in picking up crumbs of compassion thrown from the table of someone who\nconsiders himself my master. I want the full menu of rights.\n—BISHOP DESMOND TUTU, South African cleric and activist\nThe next question then becomes, “What should you delegate?” It’s a good question, but I don’t want\nto answer it. I want to watch Family Guy.\nThe truth be told, it is a hell of a lot of work writing about not working. Ritika of Brickwork and\nVenky of YMII are more than capable of writing this section, so I’ll just mention two guidelines and\nleave the mental hernia of detail work to them.\nGolden Rule #1: Each delegated task must be both time-consuming and well-defined. If you’re\nrunning around like a chicken with its head cut off and assign your VA to do that for you, it doesn’t\nimprove the order of the universe.\nGolden Rule #2: On a lighter note, have some fun with it. Have someone in Bangalore or Shanghai\nsend e-mails to friends as your personal concierge to set lunch dates or similar basics. Harass your\nboss with odd phone calls in strong accents from unknown numbers. Being effective doesn’t mean\nbeing serious all the time. It’s fun being in control for a change. Get a bit of repression off your chest\nso it doesn’t turn into a complex later.\nGetting Personal and Going Howard Hughes\nHoward Hughes, the ultrarich filmmaker and eccentric from The Aviator, was notorious for assigning odd\ntasks to his assistants. Here are a few from Donald Bartlett’s Howard Hughes: His Life and Madness you\nmight want to consider.\n1. After his first plane crash, Hughes confided in a friend that he believed his recovery was due to his\nconsumption of orange juice and its healing properties. He believed that exposure to the air diluted the\njuice’s potency, so he demanded that fresh oranges be sliced and juiced in front of him.\n2. When Hughes was partaking of the nightlife in Las Vegas, his aides were charged with approaching\nany girls he took a liking to. If a girl was invited to join the Hughes table and agreed, an aide would\npull out a waiver and agreement for her to sign.\n3. Hughes had a barber on call 24/7 but had his hair and nails trimmed about once a year.\n4. In his hotel-bound years, Hughes was rumored to have instructed assistants to place a single\ncheeseburger in a specific tree outside his penthouse room at a 4:00 P.M. each day, whether he was\nthere or not.\nSuch a world of possibilities! Just as the Model-T brought transportation to the masses, virtual\nassistants bring eccentric billionaire behavior within reach of each man, woman, and child. Now, that’s\nprogress.\nWithout further ado, let me pass the mic. Note that YMII performs both personal and business tasks,\nwhereas Brickwork focuses solely on business projects. Let’s start with the important but dull stuff and\nmove quickly from the sublime to the ridiculous. To give a true taste of what to expect, I have not\ncorrected non-native-sounding English.\nVenky: Don’t limit yourself. Just ask us if something is possible. We’ve arranged parties, organized\ncaterers, researched summer courses, cleaned up accounting books, created 3D drafts based on blueprints.\nJust ask us. We could find the closest kid-friendly restaurant to your house for your son’s birthday,\nfinding out costs and organizing the birthday party. This frees up your time to work or hang out with\nyour son.\nWhat can we not do? We can’t do anything that would require our physical presence. But you would\nbe surprised as to how small a set of tasks that is in this day and age.\nHere are the most common tasks we handle:\nscheduling interviews and meetings web-research following up on appointments, errands, and\ntasks online purchases creation of legal documents website maintenance (web design, publishing,\nuploading files) that doesn’t require a professional designer\nmonitoring, editing, and publishing\ncomments for online discussions posting job vacancies on the web document creation\nproofreading and editing documents for spelling and formatting\nonline research for updating blogs\nupdating the database for Customer Relationship Management Software\nmanaging recruitment\nprocesses updating invoices and receiving payments voicemail transcription\nRitika at Brickwork added the following:\nmarket research financial research business plans industry analysis market assessment\nreports preparing presentations reports and newsletters legal research analytics website\ndevelopment search engine optimization maintaining and updating databases credit scoring\nmanaging procurement processes\nVenky: We have a forgetful client who has us call him all the time with various reminders. One of our\nclients on a custom plan has us wake him up every morning. We’ve done the legwork and found people\nwho fell out of contact after Katrina. Found jobs for clients! My favorite so far: One of our clients has a\npair of trousers that he really likes that aren’t in production anymore. He’s sending them to Bangalore\n(from London) to have created exact replicas at a tiny fraction of the price.\nHere are a few other YMII custom requests:\nReminding an overzealous client to pay his current parking fines,\nas well as not speed and collect parking fines.\nApologizing and sending flowers and cards to spouses of clients.\nCharting a diet plan, reminding client on it regularly, ordering\ngroceries based on the specific diet plan.\nGetting a job for a person who lost his job due to outsourcing a\nyear back. We did the job search, did the cover letters, did the\nresume tuning, and got the client a job in 30 days.\nFixing a broken windowpane of a house in Geneva, Switzerland.\nCollecting homework information from teacher’s voicemail and e-\nmailing it to the client (parents of the kid).\nResearch on how to tie a shoelace meant for a kid (client’s son).\nFind a parking slot for your car in some other city even before you\nmake the trip.\nOrdered garbage bins for home.\nGet an authenticated weather forecast and weather report for a\nparticular time in a particular place on a particular day, five years\nago. This was to be used as supportive evidence for a lawsuit.\nTalking to parents in our client’s stead.\nHere’s another real example of personal outsourcing from reader David Cross, who got a personal chef\nat home for less than $5 per meal. Just thinking of the possibilities is enough to make you start drooling.\nHe explains:\nI wanted to find someone to prepare food I love. I trained as a chef but I am often so busy and as I am\nthe only one in the house who really cooks, I often don’t have time to prepare the food that makes me\nfeel the healthiest so I wrote the attached ad and dropped it on Craigslist.\nThis was a very tight focus—ultraspecific—I had just two applicants in two months—one who was a\n2/10 match but the guy we just OK’d was a Hare Krishna follower for many years, lived in India, and his\nsample menu proved he knew what he’s doing so we just started him.\nThe food is absolutely awesome. The hourly rate is *extremely reasonable,* he’s a five-minute detour\nwhen either of us are in town to collect food and I now have delicious Indian food for less than $5 a\nmeal and it’s as good as anything I’ve ever eaten anywhere.\nI’m going to progress to other cuisines now… Thai, Italian, Chinese, etc., and it means when I do have\ntime to cook I’ll enjoy doing it that much more as I am not the only one cooking!\nIndian/Asian Vegetarian Cook Needed\nDate: 2007–06–07, 12:25PM PDT\nHello.\nWe are a local, international family who love Indian and Asian vegetarian food. We are looking for a\ncook experienced in this wonderful cuisine to prepare delicious, fresh, healthy, authentic Indian/Asian\nvegetarian meals for us.\nIf you’ve cooked a curry once or twice or need to follow recipes, this position is probably not for you,\nbut if you know Indian vegetarian cooking in depth and can prepare delicious, healthy, fresh, authentic\nIndian vegetarian food then we’d like to hear from you. This could be an ideal opportunity if you are\nIndian, Pakistani, Punjabi, etc., and are looking for a great way to apply your experience and love of\nIndian vegetarian food, cooking and culture. Knowledge of Ayurved and how this relates to food and\ndiet is a plus though not essential.\nPlease reply with details of your experience and some dishes you could prepare. If we like what you\nhave to offer, we’ll arrange for you to cook a sample meal or two which we will pay you for and then\nwe’ll see what works out for us all.\nThis is a part-time position. You will be self-employed and responsible for your own taxes, etc. We’ll\npay you an hourly rate we will agree with you plus grocery bills for the food you prepare. You can\nprepare food in your own place and we can arrange to collect it from you, possibly for us to freeze for\nlater eating. We will work with you to come up with menus and schedules that work out for you and\nus.\nThank you for your interest.\nBasic Choices: New Delhi or New York?\nThere are tens of thousands of VAs—how on earth do you find the right one? The resources at the\nend of this chapter will show you where to look, but it is overwhelming and confusing unless you have a\nfew criteria determined in advance.\nIt often helps to begin with the question “Where on Earth?”\nRemote or Local?\n“Made in the USA” doesn’t have the ring it used to. The pros of jumping time zones and visiting thirdworld\ncurrency are twofold: People work while you sleep, and the per-hour expense is less. Time savings\nand cost savings. Ritika explains the former with an example.\nOne can give the remote personal assistant in India their assignment when they are leaving work at the\nend of the day in New York City, and they will have the presentation ready the next morning. Because\nof the time difference with India, assistants can work on it while they are asleep and have it back in their\nmorning. When they wake up, they will find the completed summary in their inbox. These assistants can\nalso help them keep pace with what they want to read, for example.\nIndian and Chinese VAs, as well as most from other developing countries, will run $4–15 per hour,\nthe lower end being limited to simple tasks and the higher end including the equivalent of Harvard or\nStanford M.B.A.s and Ph.D.s. Need a business plan to raise funding? Brickwork can provide it for\nbetween $2,500–5,000 instead of $15,000–20,000. Foreign assistance isn’t just for the small time. I know\nfrom firsthand discussions that executives from big five accounting and management consulting firms\nroutinely charge clients six figures for research reports that are then farmed to India for low four figures.\nIn the U.S. or Canada, the per-hour range is often $25–100. Seems like an obvious choice, right?\nBangalore 100%? It’s not. The important metric is cost per completed task, not cost per hour.\nThe biggest challenge with overseas help will be the language barrier, which often quadruples backand-forth\ndiscussion and the ultimate cost. The first time I hired an Indian VA, I made the fundamental\nmistake of not setting an hour cap for three simple tasks. I checked in later that week and found he had\nspent 23 hours chasing his tail. He had scheduled one tentative interview for the following week, set at\nthe wrong time! Mind boggling. 23 hours? It ended up costing me, at $10 per hour, $230. The same tasks,\nassigned later that week to a native English speaker in Canada, were completed in two hours at $25 per\nhour. $50 for more than four times the results. That said, I later requested another Indian VA from the\nsame firm who was able to duplicate the native speaker results.\nHow do you know which to choose? That’s the beautiful part: You don’t. It’s a matter of testing a few\nassistants to both sharpen your communication skills and determine who is worth hiring and who is\nworth firing. Being a results-based boss isn’t as simple as it looks.\nThere are a number of lessons to be learned here.\nFirst, per-hour cost is not the ultimate determinant of cost. Look at per-task cost. If you need to spend\ntime restating the task and otherwise managing the VA, determine the time required of you and add this\n(using your per-hour rate from earlier chapters) to the end sticker price of the task. It can be surprising.\nAs cool as it is to say that you have people working for you in three countries, it’s uncool to spend time\nbabysitting people who are supposed to make your life easier.\nSecond, the proof is in the pudding. It is impossible to predict how well you will work with a given\nVA without a trial. Luckily, there are things you can do to improve your odds, and one of them is using a\nVA firm instead of a solo operator.\nSolo vs. Support Team\nLet’s suppose you find the perfect VA. He or she is performing all of your noncritical tasks and you’ve\ndecided to take a much-deserved vacation to Thailand. It’s nice to know someone besides you will be\nmanning the wheel and putting out fires for a change. Finally, some relief! Two hours before your flight\nfrom Bangkok to Phuket, you receive an e-mail: Your VA is out of commission and will be in the\nhospital for the next week. Not good. Vacation FUBAR.\nI don’t like being dependent on one person, and I don’t recommend it in the least. In the world of high\ntechnology, this type of dependency would be referred to as a “single point of failure”—one fragile item\nupon which all else depends. In the world of IT, 15 the term “redundancy” is used as a selling point for\nsystems that continue to function if there is a malfunction or mechanical failure in any given part. In the\ncontext of VAs, redundancy entails having fallback support.\nI recommend that you hire a VA firm or VAs with backup teams instead of sole operators. Examples\nabound, of course, of people who have had a single assistant for decades without incident, but I suggest\nthat this is the exception rather than the rule. Better safe than sorry. Besides simple disaster avoidance, a\ngroup structure provides a pool of talent that allows you to assign multiple tasks without bothering to find\na new person with the qualifications. Brickwork and YMII both exemplify this type of structure and\nprovide a single point of contact, a personal account manager, who then farms out your tasks to the\nmost-capable people in the group and across different shifts. Need graphic design? Covered. Need\ndatabase management? Covered. I don’t like calling and coordinating multiple people. I want one-stop\nshopping and am willing to pay 10% more to have it. I encourage you to be similarly pound-wise and\npenny-foolish.\nTeam preference doesn’t mean that bigger is better, just that multiple people are better than one\nperson. The best VA I have used to date is an Indian with five backup assistants under him. Three can be\nmore than sufficient, but two is toeing the line.\nThe #1 Fear: “Sweetheart, Did You Buy\na Porsche in China?”\nI’m sure you might have your fears. AJ certainly did:\nMy outsourcers now know an alarming amount about me—not just my schedule but my cholesterol, my\ninfertility problems, my Social Security number, my passwords (including the one that is a particularly\nadolescent curse word). Sometimes I worry that I can’t piss off my outsourcers or I’ll end up with a\n$12,000 charge on my MasterCard bill from the Louis Vuitton in Anantapur.\nThe good news is that misuse of financial and confidential information is rare. In all of the interviews I\nconducted for this section, I could find only one case of information abuse, and I had to search long and\nhard. It involved an overworked U.S.-based VA who hired freelance help at the last moment.\nCommit to memory the following—never use the new hire. Prohibit small-operation VAs from\nsubcontracting work to untested freelancers without your written permission. The more established and\nhigher-end firms, Brickwork in the below example, have security measures that border on excessive and\nmake it simple to pinpoint abusers in the case of a breach:\nEmployees undergo background checks and sign NDAs\n(nondisclosure agreements) in accordance with the company\npolicy of maintaining confidentiality of client information\nElectronic access card for entry and exit\nCredit card information keyed only by select supervisors\nRemoval of paper from the offices is prohibited\nVLAN-based access restrictions between different teams; this\nensures that there is no unauthorized access of information\nbetween people of different teams in the organization\nRegular reporting on printer logs\nFloppy drives and USB ports disabled\nBS779 certification for accomplished international security\nstandards\n128-bit encryption technology for all data exchange\nSecure VPN connection\nI bet there is a fair chance that sensitive data is 100 times safer with Brickwork than on your own\ncomputer.\nStill, information theft is best thought of as inevitable in a digital world, and precautions should be\ntaken with damage control in mind. There are two rules that I use to minimize damage and allow for fast\nrepair.\n1. Never use debit cards for online transactions or with remote assistants. Reversing unauthorized credit\ncard charges, particularly with American Express, is painless and near instantaneous. Recovering funds\nwithdrawn from your checking account via unauthorized debit card use takes dozens of hours in\npaperwork alone and can take months to receive, if approved at all.\n2. If your VA will be accessing websites on your behalf, create a new unique login and password to be\nused on those sites. Most of us reuse both logins and passwords on multiple sites, and taking this\nprecaution limits possible damage. Instruct them to use these unique logins to create accounts on new\nsites if needed. Note that this is particularly important when using assistants who have access to live\ncommercial websites (developers, programmers, etc.).\nIf information or identity theft hasn’t hit you, it will. Use these guidelines and you’ll realize when it\nhappens that, just like most nightmares, it’s not that big a deal and is reversible.\nThe Complicated Art of Simplicity:\nCommon Complaints\nMy assistant is an idiot! It took him 23 hours to book an interview! This was the first complaint I\nhad, for sure. 23 hours! I was heated up for a shouting match. My original e-mail to this first assistant\nseemed clear enough.\nDear Abdul,\nHere are the first tasks, due at the end of next Tuesday. Please call or e-mail with any questions:\n1. Go to this article http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12666060/site/newsweek/, get the phone/email/website\ncontacts for Carol Milligan and Marc and Julie Szekely. Also find the same info for Rob\nLong here http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12652789/site/newsweek/.\n2. Schedule 30-minute interviews for Carol, Marc/Julie, and Rob. Use www.myevents.com\n(username: notreal, password: donttryit) to book them in my calendar for next week any time between\n9–9 ET.\n3. Find the name, e-mail, and phone (phone is least important) of workers in the U.S. who have\nnegotiated remote work agreements (telecommuting) despite resistant bosses. Those who have\ntraveled outside the U.S. are ideal. Other keywords could include “teleworking” and\n“telecommuting.” The important factor is that they negotiated with difficult bosses. Please send me\nlinks to their profiles or write a paragraph describing why they fit the profile above.\nLook forward to seeing what you can do. Please e-mail if you don’t understand or have questions.\nBest,\nTim\nThe truth is—I was at fault. This is not a good debut demand, and I made fatal mistakes even before\ncomposing it. If you are an effective person but unaccustomed to issuing commands, assume that most\nproblems at the outset are your fault. It is tempting to immediately point the finger at someone else and\nhuff and puff, but most beginner bosses repeat the same mistakes I made.\n1. I accepted the first person the firm provided and made no special requests at the outset.\nRequest someone who has “excellent” English and indicate that phone calls will be required (even if not).\nBe fast to request a replacement if there are repeated communication issues.\n2. I gave imprecise directions.\nI asked him to schedule interviews but didn’t indicate that it was for an article. He assumed, based on\nwork with previous clients, that I wanted to hire someone and he misspent time compiling spreadsheets\nand combing online job sites for additional information I didn’t need.\nSentences should have one possible interpretation and be suitable for a 2nd-grade reading level. This\ngoes for native speakers as well and will make requests clearer. Ten-dollar words disguise imprecision.\nNote that I asked him to respond if he didn’t understand or had questions. This is the wrong approach.\nAsk foreign VAs to rephrase tasks to confirm understanding before getting started.\n3. I gave him a license to waste time.\nThis brings us again to damage control. Request a status update after a few hours of work on a task to\nensure that the task is both understood and achievable. Some tasks are, after initial attempts, impossible.\n4. I set the deadline a week in advance.\nUse Parkinson’s Law and assign tasks that are to be completed within no more than 72 hours. I have had\nthe best luck with 48 and 24 hours. This is another compelling reason to use a small group (three or\nmore) rather than a single individual who can become overtaxed with last-minute requests from multiple\nclients. Using short deadlines does not mean avoiding larger tasks (e.g., business plan), but rather\nbreaking them into smaller milestones that can be completed in shorter time frames (outline, competitive\nresearch summaries, chapters, etc.).\n5. I gave him too many tasks and didn’t set an order of importance.\nI advise sending one task at a time whenever possible and no more than two. If you want to cause your\ncomputer to hang or crash, open 20 windows and applications at the same time. If you want to do the\nsame to your assistant, assign him or her a dozen tasks without prioritizing them. Recall our mantra:\nEliminate before you delegate.\nWHAT DOES A good VA task e-mail look like? The following example was recently sent to an Indian VA\nwhose results have been nothing short of spectacular:\nDear Sowmya,\nThank you. I would like to start with the following task.\nTASK: I need to find the names and e-mails of editors of men’s magazines in the US (for example:\nmaxim, stuff, GQ, esquire, blender, etc.) who also have written books. An example of such a person\nwould be AJ Jacobs who is Editor-at-Large of Esquire (www.ajjacobs.com). I already have his\ninformation and need more like him.\nCan you do this? If not, please advise. Please reply and confirm what you will plan to do to\ncomplete this task.\nDEADLINE: Since I’m in a rush, get started after your next e-mail and stop at 3 hours and tell me\nwhat results you have. Please begin this task now if possible. The deadline for these 3 hours and\nreported results is end-of-day ET Monday.\nThank you for your fastest reply,\nTim\nShort, sweet, and to the point. Clear writing, and therefore clear commands, come from clear thinking.\nThink simple.\nIN THE NEXT several chapters, the communication skills you develop with our virtual assistant experiment\nwill be applied to a much larger and obscenely profitable playing field: automation. The extent to which\nyou will outsource next makes delegation look like finger painting.\nIn the world of automation, not all business models are created equal. How do you assemble a\nbusiness and coordinate all its parts without lifting a finger? How do you automate cash deposits in your\nbank account while avoiding the most common problems? It begins with understanding the options, the\nart of dodging information flow, and what we will call “muses.”\nThe next chapter is a blueprint for the first step: a product.\nGo with the Flow\nHere is a flowchart of 4HWW from reader Jed Wood, who has used it for faster decision making,\nmore output with less input, and more time with his wife and children.\nQ&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS\n1. Get an assistant—even if you don’t need one.\nDevelop the comfort of commanding and not being commanded. Begin with a one-time test project or\nsmall repetitive task (daily preferred). I advise using domestic help for language-intensive tasks and using\nforeign assistants in the early stages to improve the general clarity of your communication. Pick one\nfrom each group and get started.\nThe following sites, split up geographically, are useful resources.\nU.S. and Canada ($20/hour+)\nhttp://www.iavoa.com (International Association of Virtual Office Assistants). Global directory that\nincludes the U.S.\nhttp://www.cvac.ca (Canadian Virtual Assistant Connection)\nhttp://www.canadianva.net/files/va-locator.html (Canada)\nwww.onlinebusinessmanager.com\nNorth America and International ($4/hour+)\nwww.elance.com (Search “virtual assistants,” “personal assistants,” and “executive assistants.”) The\nclient feedback reviews on Elance enabled me to find my best VA to date, who costs $4/hour. Similar\nmarketplaces with positive reviews include www.guru.com and www.rentacoder.com.\nIndia\nwww.tryasksunday.com ($20–60 per month for 24/7 concierge, free one-week trial). AskSunday is one\nof the sophisticated new kids on the personal outsourcing block. Their site was nominated the #2 website\nof the year in 2007 by Time magazine. Just dial a 212 (NYC) area code and get routed to well-spoken\nassistants in India and the Philippines. I use this service 80% of the time, as most tasks take less than 10\nminues to complete. For longer projects, there are teams available for $12/hour.\nwww.b2kcorp.com ($15/hour+) From Fortune 10 oil companies and Fortune 500 clients to Big 5\naccounting firms and U.S. congressmen, Brickwork can handle it all. This is reflected in the costs of this\npure suit-and-tie operation—business only. No flowers for auntie.\nwww.taskseveryday.com ($6.98/hour for a dedicated virtual assistant) Based in Mumbai, available via\nphone and e-mail from the U.S., UK, and Australia. Must choose between 20 or 40 hours per week and\npre-purchase hours.\nwww.yourmaninindia.com ($6.25/hour+) YMII handles both business and personal tasks and can work\nwith you in real time (there are people on duty 24/7) and complete work while you sleep. English\ncapability and effectiveness vary tremendously across VAs, so interview yours before getting started or\nassigning important tasks. Important: Following the publication of the first edition of this book, there\nhave been some complaints of lower quality and up to four-week wait lists to become a client.\n2. Start small but think big.\nTina Forsyth, an online business manager (higher-level VA) who helps six-figure-income clients achieve\nseven figures with business model redesigns, makes the following recommendations.\nLook at your to-do list—what has been sitting on it the longest?\nEach time you are interrupted or change tasks, ask, “Could a VA\ndo this?”\nExamine pain points—what causes you the most frustration and\nboredom?\nHere are a few common time-consumers in small businesses with online presences.\nSubmitting articles to drive traffic to site and build mailing lists\nParticipating in or moderating discussion forums and message\nboards\nManaging affiliate programs\nCreating content for and publishing newsletters and blog postings\nBackground research components of new marketing initiatives or\nanalysis of current marketing results\nDon’t expect miracles from a single VA, but don’t expect too little, either. Let go of the controls a bit.\nDon’t assign crap tasks that end up consuming rather than saving time. It makes little sense to spend 10–\n15 minutes sending an e-mail to India to get a price quote on a plane ticket when you could do the same\nonline in 10 minutes and avoid all the subsequent back-and-forth.\nPush outside your comfort zone—that is the entire point of the exercise.\nIt is always possible to reclaim a task for yourself if the VA proves incapable, so test the limits of their\ncapabilities. Remember Brickwork’s suggestion: Don’t limit yourself.\n3. Identify your top five time-consuming non-work tasks and five personal tasks you could assign\nfor sheer fun.\n4. Keep in sync: scheduling and calendars.\nIf you decide to have an assistant schedule appointments and add things to your calendar, it will be\nimportant to ensure what you both see is updated. There are several options:\nBusySync (www.busysync.com) I have two Gmail accounts: one private account for me and one for my\nassistant, where general e-mail is sent. I use BusySync to synchronize her Google Calendar with iCal\n(Mac calendar) on my laptop. I have also used SpanningSync (www.spanningsync.com) successfully for\nthe same purpose.\nWebEx Office (www.weboffice.com) Share your calendar online while masking personal appointments.\nCan be synchronized with Outlook, and also offers document sharing and other assistant- or teamfriendly\nfeatures. I suggest you compare this to synchronizing your Outlook with an assistant’s Google\nCalendar.\nCOMFORT CHALLENGE\nUse the Criticism Sandwich (2 Days and Weekly)\nChances are good that someone—be it a co-worker, boss, customer, or significant other—does\nsomething irritating or at a subpar level. Rather than avoid the topic out of fear of confrontation, let’s\nchocolate-coat it and ask them to fix it. Once per day for two days, and then each Thursday (M-W is too\ntense and Friday is too relaxed) for the next three weeks, resolve to use what I call the Criticism\nSandwich with someone. It’s called the Criticism Sandwich because you first praise the person for\nsomething, then deliver the criticism, and then close with topic-shifting praise to exit the sensitive topic.\nHere’s an example with a superior or boss, with keywords and phrases in italics.\nYou: Hi, Mara. Do you have a second?\nMara: Sure. What’s up?\nYou: First, I wanted to thank you for helping me with the Meelie Worm account [or whatever]. I really\nappreciate you showing me how to handle that. You’re really good at fixing the technical issues.\nMara: No problem.\nYou: Here’s the thing. 16 There is a lot of work coming down on everyone, and I’m feeling 17 a bit\noverwhelmed. Normally, priorities are really clear to me 18 but I’ve been having trouble recently figuring\nout which tasks are highest on the list. Could you help me by pointing out the most important items when\na handful need to be done? I’m sure it’s just me, 19 but I’d really appreciate it, and I think it would help.\nMara: Uhh … I’ll see what I can do.\nYou: That means a lot to me. Thanks. Before I forget, 20 last week’s presentation was excellent.\nMara: Did you think so? Blah, blah, blah …\nLIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION\nTHE BEST TIMES TO SEND E-MAIL\nYou’ve suggested people check e-mail only a few times a day. Here’s a twist: I reply to e-mails\nwhen it’s convenient, but I time it to arrive when it’s also convenient for me. In Outlook you can\ndelay e-mail delivery to any time of day. For example, when I return e-mails at 3 p.m., I don’t want\nmy staff instantly zinging me responses or clarifying questions. (This also prevents e-mail chats.) So I\nhit send, but it’s delayed to arrive later in the evening or at 8 A.M. when my employees arrive the\nnext day. This is how e-mail was meant to be! It’s mail, not a chat service.\n—JIM LARRANAGA\n14. To leverage global pricing and currency differences for profit or lifestyle purposes.\n15. Information technology.\n16. Don’t call it a problem if you can avoid it.\n17. No one can argue with your feelings, so use this to avoid a debate about external circumstances.\n18. Notice how I take “you” out of the sentence to avoid finger-pointing, even though it’s implicit.\n“Normally, you make priorities clear” sounds like a backhanded insult. If this is a significant other,\nyou can skip this formality, but never use “you always do X,” which is just a fight starter.\n19. Take a little bit of the heat off with this. The point has already been made.\n20. “Before I forget” is a great segue to the closing compliment, which is also a topic shifter and gets\nyou off the sensitive topic without awkwardness.\nIncome Autopilot I\nFINDING THE MUSE\nJust set it and forget it!\n—RON POPEIL, founder of RONCO; responsible for more than $1 billion in sales of rotisserie\nchicken roasters\nAs to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who\ngrasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods,\nignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.\n—RALPH WALDO EMERSON\nThe Renaissance Minimalist\nDouglas Price was waking up to another beautiful summer morning in his Brooklyn brownstone. First\nthings first: coffee. The jet lag was minor, considering he had just returned from a two-week jaunt\nthrough the islands of Croatia. It was just one of six countries he had visited in the last 12 months. Japan\nwas next on the agenda.\nBuzzing with a smile and his coffee mug in hand, he ambled over to his Mac to check on personal e-\nmail first. There were 32 messages and all brought good news.\nOne of his friends and business partners, also a cofounder of Limewire, had an update: Last Bamboo,\ntheir start-up poised to reinvent peer-to-peer technology, was rounding the final corners of development.\nIt could be their billion-dollar baby, but Doug was letting the engineers run wild first.\nSamson Projects, one of the hottest contemporary art galleries in Boston, had compliments for Doug’s\nlatest work and requests for expanded involvement with new exhibits as their sound curator.\nThe last e-mail in his inbox was a fan letter addressed to “Demon Doc” and praise for his latest\ninstrumental hip-hop album, onliness VI.O.I. Doug had released his album as what he termed “open\nsource music”—anyone could download the album for free and use sounds from any track in his or her\nown compositions.\nHe smiled again, polished off his dark roast, and opened a window to deal with business e-mail next.\nIt would take much less time. In fact, less than 30 minutes for the day and 2 hours for the week.\nHow much things change.\nTwo years earlier, in June of 2004, I was in Doug’s apartment checking e-mail for what I hoped would\nbe the last time for a long time. I was headed to JFK Airport in New York in a matter of hours and was\npreparing for an indefinite quest around the world. Doug looked on with amusement. He had similar\nplans for himself and was finally extricating himself from a venture-funded Internet startup that had once\nbeen a cover story and his passion but was now just a job. The euphoria of the dot-com era was long\ndead, along with most chances for a sale or an IPO.\nHe bid me farewell and made a decision as the taxi pulled from the curb—enough of the complicated\nstuff. It was time to return to basics.\nProsoundeffects.com, launched in January of 2005 after one week of sales testing on eBay, was\ndesigned to do one thing: give Doug lots of cash with minimal time investment.\nThis brings us back to his business inbox in 2006.\nThere are 10 orders for sound libraries, CDs that film producers, musicians, video game designers, and\nother audio professionals use to add hard-to-find sounds—whether the purr of a lemur or an exotic\ninstrument—to their own creations. These are Doug’s products, but he doesn’t own them, as that would\nrequire physical inventory and upfront cash. His business model is more elegant than that. Here is just\none revenue stream:\n1. A prospective customer sees his Pay-Per-Click (PPC) advertising on Google or other search\nengines and clicks through to his site, www.prosoundeffects.com.\n2. The prospect orders a product for $325 (the average purchase price, though prices range from $29–\n7,500) on a Yahoo shopping cart, and a PDF with all their billing and shipping information is\nautomatically e-mailed to Doug.\n3. Three times a week, Doug presses a single button in the Yahoo management page to charge all his\ncustomers’ credit cards and put cash in his bank account. Then he saves the PDFs as Excel purchase\norders and e-mails the purchase orders to the manufacturers of the CD libraries. Those companies\nmail the products to Doug’s customers—this is called drop-shipping—and Doug pays the\nmanufacturers as little as 45% of the retail price of the products up to 90 days later (net-90 terms).\nLet’s look at the mathematical beauty of his system for full effect.\nFor each $325 order at his cost of 55% off retail, Doug is entitled to $178.75. If we subtract 1% of the\nfull retail price (1% of $325 = $3.25) for the Yahoo Store transaction fee and 2.5% for the credit card\nprocessing fee (2.5% of $325 = $8.13), Doug is left with a pretax profit of $167.38 for this one sale.\nMultiply this by 10 and we have $1673.80 in profit for 30 minutes of work. Doug is making $3,347.60\nper hour and purchases no product in advance. His initial start-up costs were $1,200 for the webpage\ndesign, which he recouped in the first week. His PPC advertising costs approximately $700 per month\nand he pays Yahoo $99 per month for their hosting and shopping cart.\nHe works less than two hours a week, often pulls more than $10,000 per month, and there is no\nfinancial risk whatsoever.\nNow Doug spends his time making music, traveling, and exploring new businesses for excitement.\nProsoundeffects.com is not his end-all-be-all, but it has removed all financial concerns and freed his\nmind to focus on other things.\nWhat would you do if you didn’t have to think about money? If you follow the advice in this chapter,\nyou will soon have to answer this question.\nIt’s time to find your muse.\nTHERE ARE A million and one ways to make a million dollars. From franchising to freelance consulting,\nthe list is endless. Fortunately, most of them are unsuited to our purpose. This chapter is not for people\nwho want to run businesses but for those who want to own businesses and spend no time on them.\nThe response I get when I introduce this concept is more or less universal: Huh?\nPeople can’t believe that most of the ultrasuccessful companies in the world do not manufacture their\nown products, answer their own phones, ship their own products, or service their own customers. There\nare hundreds of companies that exist to pretend to work for someone else and handle these functions,\nproviding rentable infrastructure to anyone who knows where to find them.\nThink Microsoft manufactures the Xbox 360 or that Kodak designs and distributes their digital\ncameras? Guess again. Flextronics, a Singapore-based engineering and manufacturing firm with\nlocations in 30 countries and $15.3 billion in annual revenue, does both. Most popular brands of\nmountain bikes in the U.S. are all manufactured in the same three or four plants in China. Dozens of call\ncenters press one button to answer calls for the JC Penneys of the world, another to answer calls for the\nDell Computers of the world, and yet another to answer calls for the New Rich like me.\nIt’s all beautifully transparent and cheap.\nBefore we create this virtual architecture, however, we need a product to sell. If you own a service\nbusiness, this section will help you convert expertise into a downloadable or shippable good to escape the\nlimits of a per-hour-based model. If starting from scratch, ignore service businesses for now, as constant\ncustomer contact makes absence difficult. 21\nTo narrow the field further, our target product can’t take more than $500 to test, it has to lend itself to\nautomation within four weeks, and—when up and running—it can’t require more than one day per week\nof management.\nCan a business be used to change the world, like The Body Shop or Patagonia? Yes, but that isn’t our\ngoal here.\nCan a business be used to cash out through an IPO or sale? Yes, but that isn’t our goal either.\nOur goal is simple: to create an automated vehicle for generating cash without consuming time. That’s\nit. 22 I will call this vehicle a “muse” whenever possible to separate it from the ambiguous term\n“business,” which can refer to a lemonade stand or a Fortune 10 oil conglomerate—our objective is more\nlimited and thus requires a more precise label.\nSo first things first: cash flow and time. With these two currencies, all other things are possible.\nWithout them, nothing is possible.\nWhy to Begin with the End in Mind: A Cautionary Tale\nSarah is excited.\nIt has been two weeks since her line of humorous T-shirts for golfers went online, and she is averaging\n5 T-shirt sales per day at $15 each. Her cost per unit is $5, so she is grossing $50 in profit (minus 3% in\ncredit card fees) per 24 hours, as she passes shipping and handling on to customers. She should soon\nrecoup the cost of her initial order of 300 shirts (including plate charges, setup, etc.)—but wants to earn\nmore.\nIt’s a nice reversal of fortune, considering the fate of her first product. She had spent $12,000 to\ndevelop, patent, and manufacture a high-tech stroller for new moms (she has never been a new mom),\nonly to find that no one was interested.\nThe T-shirts, in contrast, were actually selling, but sales were beginning to slow.\nIt appears she has reached her online sales ceiling, as well-funded and uneducated competitors are now\nspending too much for advertising and driving up costs. Then it strikes her—retail!\nSarah approaches the manager of her local golf shop, Bill, who immediately expresses interest in\ncarrying the shirts. She’s thrilled.\nBill asks for the customary 40% minimum discount for wholesale pricing. This means her sell price is\nnow $9 instead of $15 and her profit has dropped from $10 to $4. Sarah decides to give it a shot and\ndoes the same with three other stores in surrounding towns. The shirts begin to move off the shelves, but\nshe soon realizes that her small profit is being eaten by extra hours she spends handling invoices and\nadditional administration.\nShe decides to approach a distributor 23 to alleviate this labor, a company that acts as a shipping\nwarehouse and sells products from various manufacturers to golf stores nationwide. The distributor is\ninterested and asks for its usual pricing—70% off of retail or $4.50—which would leave Sarah 50 cents\nin the hole on each unit. She declines.\nTo make matters worse, the four local stores have already started discounting her shirts to compete\namong one another and are killing their own profit margins. Two weeks later, reorders disappear. Sarah\nabandons retail and returns to her website demoralized. Sales online have dropped to almost nothing with\nnew competition. She has not recouped her initial investment, and she still has 50 shirts in her garage.\nNot good.\nIt all could have been prevented with proper testing and planning.\nED “MR. CREATINE” BYRD is no Sarah. He does not invest and hope for the best.\nHis San Francisco–based company, MRI, had the top-selling sports supplement in the U.S. from\n2002–2005, NO 2 . It is still a top-seller despite dozens of imitators. He did it through smart testing, smart\npositioning, and brilliant distribution.\nPrior to manufacturing, MRI first offered a low-priced book related to the product through ¼-page\nadvertisements in men’s health magazines. Once the need had been confirmed with a mountain of book\norders, NO 2 was priced at an outrageous $79.95, positioned as the premium product on the market, and\nsold exclusively through GNC stores nationwide. No one else was permitted to sell it.\nHow can it make sense to turn away business? There are a few good reasons.\nFirst, the more competing resellers there are, the faster your product goes extinct. This was one of\nSarah’s mistakes.\nIt works like this: Reseller A sells the product for your recommended advertised price of $50, then\nreseller B sells it for $45 to compete with A, and then C sells it for $40 to compete with A and B. In no\ntime at all, no one is making profit from selling your product and reorders disappear. Customers are now\naccustomed to the lower pricing and the process is irreversible. The product is dead and you need to\ncreate a new product. This is precisely the reason why so many companies need to create new product\nafter new product month after month. It’s a headache.\nI had one single supplement, BrainQUICKEN® (also sold as BodyQUICK®) for six years and\nmaintained a consistent profit margin by limiting wholesale distribution, particularly online, to the top\none or two largest resellers who could move serious quantities of product and who agreed to maintain a\nminimum advertised pricing. 24 Otherwise, rogue discounters on eBay and mom-and-pop independents\nwill drive you broke.\nSecond, if you offer someone exclusivity, which most manufacturers try to avoid, it can work in your\nfavor. Since you are offering one company 100% of the distribution, it is possible to negotiate better\nprofit margins (offering less of a discount off of retail price), better marketing support in-store, faster\npayment, and other preferential treatment.\nIt is critical that you decide how you will sell and distribute your product before you commit to a\nproduct in the first place. The more middlemen are involved, the higher your margins must be to maintain\nprofitability for all the links in the chain.\nEd Byrd realized this and exemplifies how doing the opposite of what most do can reduce risk and\nincrease profit. Choosing distribution before product is just one example.\nEd drives a Lamborghini down the California coast when not traveling or in the office with his small\nfocused staff and his two Australian shepherds. This outcome is not accidental. His product-creation\nmethods—and those of the New Rich in general—can be emulated.\nHere’s how you do it in the fewest number of steps.\nStep One: Pick an Affordably Reachable Niche Market\nWhen I was younger … I [didn’t] want to be pigeonholed … Basically, now you want to be\npigeonholed. It’s your niche.\n—JOAN CHEN, actress; appeared in The Last Emperor and Twin Peaks\nCreating demand is hard. Filling demand is much easier. Don’t create a product, then seek someone\nto sell it to. Find a market—define your customers—then find or develop a product for them.\nI have been a student and an athlete, so I developed products for those markets, focusing on the male\ndemographic whenever possible. The audiobook I created for college guidance counselors failed because\nI have never been a guidance counselor. I developed the subsequent speed-reading seminar after\nrealizing that I had free access to students, and the business succeeded because—being a student myself\n—I understood their needs and spending habits. Be a member of your target market and don’t speculate\nwhat others need or will be willing to buy.\nStart Small, Think Big\nSome people are just into lavish dwarf entertainment.\n–DANNY BLACK (42″), part-owner of Shortdwarf.com 25\nDanny Black rents dwarfs as entertainment for $149 per hour. How is that for a niche market?\nIt is said that if everyone is your customer, then no one is your customer. If you start off aiming to sell\na product to dog- or car-lovers, stop. It’s expensive to advertise to such a broad market, and you are\ncompeting with too many products and too much free information. If you focus on how to train German\nshepherds or a restoration product for antique Fords, on the other hand, the market and competition\nshrink, making it less expensive to reach your customers and easier to charge premium pricing.\nBrainQUICKEN was initially designed for students, but the market proved too scattered and difficult\nto reach. Based on positive feedback from student-athletes, I relaunched the product as BodyQUICK and\ntested advertising in magazines specific to martial artists and powerlifters. These are minuscule markets\ncompared to the massive student market, but not small. Low media cost and lack of competition enabled\nme to dominate with the first “neural accelerator” 26 in these niches. It is more profitable to be a big fish\nin a small pond than a small undefined fish in a big pond. How do you know if it’s big enough to meet\nyour TMI? For a detailed real-life example of how I determined the market size of a recent product, see\n“Muse Math” on this book’s companion site.\nAsk yourself the following questions to find profitable niches.\n1. Which social, industry, and professional groups do you belong to, have you belonged to, or do\nyou understand, whether dentists, engineers, rock climbers, recreational cyclists, car restoration\naficionados, dancers, or other?\nLook creatively at your resume, work experience, physical habits, and hobbies and compile a list of all\nthe groups, past and present, that you can associate yourself with. Look at products and books you own,\ninclude online and offline subscriptions, and ask yourself, “What groups of people purchase the same?”\nWhich magazines, websites, and newsletters do you read on a regular basis?\n2. Which of the groups you identified have their own magazines?\nVisit a large bookstore such as Barnes & Noble and browse the magazine rack for smaller specialty\nmagazines to brainstorm additional niches. There are literally thousands of occupation- and\ninterest/hobby-specific magazines to choose from. Use Writer’s Market to identify magazine options\noutside the bookstores. Narrow the groups from question 1 above to those that are reachable through one\nor two small magazines. It’s not important that these groups all have a lot of money (e.g., golfers)—only\nthat they spend money (amateur athletes, bass fishermen, etc.) on products of some type. Call these\nmagazines, speak to the advertising directors, and tell them that you are considering advertising; ask them\nto e-mail their current advertising rate card and include both readership numbers and magazine backissue\nsamples. Search the back issues for repeat advertisers who sell direct-to-consumer via 800 numbers\nor websites—the more repeat advertisers, and the more frequent their ads, the more profitable a\nmagazine is for them … and will be for us.\nStep Two: Brainstorm (Do Not Invest In) Products\nGenius is only a superior power of seeing.\n—JOHN RUSKIN, famed art and social critic\nPick the two markets that you are most familiar with that have their own magazines with full-page\nadvertising that costs less than $5,000. There should be no fewer than 15,000 readers.\nThis is the fun part. Now we get to brainstorm or find products with these two markets in mind.\nThe goal is come up with well-formed product ideas and spend nothing; in Step 3, we will create\nadvertising for them and test responses from real customers before investing in manufacturing. There are\nseveral criteria that ensure the end product will fit into an automated architecture.\nThe Main Benefit Should Be Encapsulated in One Sentence.\nPeople can dislike you—and you often sell more by offending some—but they should never\nmisunderstand you.\nThe main benefit of your product should be explainable in one sentence or phrase. How is it different\nand why should I buy it? ONE sentence or phrase, folks. Apple did an excellent job of this with the iPod.\nInstead of using the usual industry jargon with GB, bandwidth, and so forth, they simply said, “1,000\nsongs in your pocket.” Done deal. Keep it simple and do not move ahead with a product until you can do\nthis without confusing people.\nIt Should Cost the Customer $50–200.\nThe bulk of companies set prices in the midrange, and that is where the most competition is. Pricing low\nis shortsighted, because someone else is always willing to sacrifice more profit margin and drive you\nboth bankrupt. Besides perceived value, there are three main benefits to creating a premium, high-end\nimage and charging more than the competition.\n1. Higher pricing means that we can sell fewer units—and thus manage fewer customers—and fulfill\nour dreamlines. It’s faster.\n2. Higher pricing attracts lower-maintenance customers (better credit, fewer complaints/questions,\nfewer returns, etc.). It’s less headache. This is HUGE.\n3. Higher pricing also creates higher profit margins. It’s safer.\nI personally aim for an 8–10x markup, which means a $100 product can’t cost me more than $10–\n12.50. 27 If I had used the commonly recommended 5 x markup with BrainQUICKEN, it would have\ngone bankrupt within 6 months due to a dishonest supplier and late magazine. The profit margin saved it,\nand within 12 months it was generating up to $80,000 per month.\nHigh has its limits, however. If the per-unit price is above a certain point, prospects need to speak to\nsomeone on the phone before they are comfortable enough to make the purchase. This is contraindicated\non our low-information diet.\nI have found that a price range of $50–200 per sale provides the most profit for the least customer\nservice hassle. Price high and then justify.\nIt Should Take No More Than 3 to 4 Weeks to Manufacture.\nThis is critically important for keeping costs low and adapting to sales demand without stockpiling\nproduct in advance. I will not pursue any product that takes more than three to four weeks to\nmanufacture, and I recommend aiming for one to two weeks from order placement to shippable product.\nHow do you know how long something takes to manufacture?\nContact contract manufacturers who specialize in the type of products you’re considering:\nhttp://www.thomasnet.com/. Call a related manufacturer (e.g., toilet bowls) if you need a referral to a\nrelated manufacturer you cannot find (e.g., toilet cleaning solutions). Still no luck? Google different\nsynonyms for your product in combination with “organization” and “association” to contact the\nappropriate industry organizations. Ask them for referrals to contract manufacturers and for the names of\ntheir trade magazines, which often contain advertisements for contract manufacturers and related service\nproviders we’ll need for your virtual architecture later. Request pricing from the contract manufacturers\nto ensure the proper markup is possible. Determine the per-unit costs of production for 100, 500, 1,000,\nand 5,000 units.\nIt Should Be Fully Explainable in a Good Online FAQ.\nHere is where I really screwed up in my product choice with Brain-QUICKEN.\nEven though ingestibles have enabled my NR life, I would not wish them on anyone. Why not? You\nget 1,000 questions from every customer: Can I eat bananas with your product? Will it make me fart\nduring dinner? On and on, ad nauseam. Choose a product that you can fully explain in a good online\nFAQ. If not, the task of travelling and otherwise forgetting about work becomes very difficult or you end\nup spending a fortune on call center operators.\nUnderstanding these criteria, a question remains: “How does one obtain a good muse product that\nsatisfies them?” There are three options we’ll cover in ascending order of recommendation.\nOption One: Resell a Product\nPurchasing an existing product at wholesale and reselling it is the easiest route but also the least\nprofitable. It is the fastest to set up but the fastest to die off due to price competition with other resellers.\nThe profitable life span of each product is short unless an exclusivity agreement prevents others from\nselling it. Reselling is, however, an excellent option for secondary back-end 28 products that can be sold\nto existing customers or cross-sold 29 to new customers online or on the phone.\nTo purchase at wholesale, use these steps.\n1. Contact the manufacturer and request a “wholesale pricelist” (generally 40% off retail) and terms.\n2. If a business tax ID number is needed, print out the proper forms from your state’s Secretary of\nState website and file for an LLC (which I prefer) or similar protective business structure for\n$100–200.\nDo NOT purchase product until you have completed Step 3 in the next chapter. It is enough at this\npoint to confirm the profit margin and have product photos and sales literature.\nThat’s reselling. Not much more to it.\nOption Two: License a Product\nI not only use all the brains that I have, but all that I can borrow.\n—WOODROW WILSON\nSome of the world’s best-known brands and products have been borrowed from someone or\nsomewhere else.\nThe basis for the energy drink Red Bull came from a tonic in Thailand, and the Smurfs were brought\nfrom Belgium. Pokémon came from the land of Honda. The band KISS made millions in record and\nconcert sales, but the real profit has been in licensing—granting others the right to produce hundreds of\nproducts with their name and image in exchange for a percentage of sales.\nThere are two parties involved in a licensing deal, and a member of the New Rich could be either.\nFirst, there is the inventor of the product, 30 called the “licensor,” who can sell others the right to\nmanufacture, use, or sell his or her product, usually for 3–10% of the wholesale price (usually around\n40% off retail) for each unit sold. Invent, let someone else do the rest, and cash checks. Not a bad model.\nThe other side of the equation is the person interested in manufacturing and selling the inventor’s\nproduct for 90–97% of the profit: the licensee. This is, for me and most NR, more interesting.\nLicensing is, however, dealmaking-intensive on both sides and a science unto itself. Creative contract\nnegotiation is essential and most readers will run into problems if it’s their first product. For real-world\ncase studies on both sides, ranging from Teddy Ruxpin to Tae-Bo, and full agreements with actual dollar\namounts, visit www.fourhourblog.com. From how to sell inventions without prototypes or patents to how\nto secure rights to products as a no-name beginner, it’s all there. The economics are fascinating and the\nprofits can be astounding.\nIn the meantime, we will focus on the least complicated and most profitable option open to the most\npeople: product creation.\nOption Three: Create a Product\nCreation is a better means of self-expression than possession; it is through creating, not\npossessing, that life is revealed.\n—VIDA D. SCUDDER, The Life of the Spirit in the Modern English Poets\nCreating a product is not complicated. “Create” sounds more involved than it actually is. If the idea is\na hard product—an invention—it is possible to hire mechanical engineers or industrial designers on\nwww.elance.com to develop a prototype based on your description of its function and appearance, which\nis then taken to a contract manufacturer. If you find a generic or stock product made by a contract\nmanufacturer that can be re-purposed or positioned for a special market, it’s even easier: Have them\nmanufacture it, stick a custom label on it for you, and presto—new product. This latter example is often\nreferred to as “private labeling.” Have you ever seen a massage therapist’s office with its own line of\nvitamin products or the Kirkland brand at Costco? Private labeling in action.\nIt is true that we’ll be testing market response without manufacturing, but if the test is successful,\nmanufacturing is the next step. This means we need to keep in mind setup costs, per-unit costs, and order\nminimums. Innovative gadgets and devices are great but often require special tooling, which makes the\nmanufacturing start-up costs too expensive to meet our criteria.\nPutting mechanical devices aside and forgetting about welding and engineering, there is one class of\nproduct that meets all of our criteria, has a manufacturing lead time of less than a week in small\nquantities, and often permits not just an 8–10 x markup, but a 20–50 x markup.\nNo, not heroin or slave labor. Too much bribing and human interaction required.\nInformation.\nInformation products are low-cost, fast to manufacture, and time-consuming for competitors to\nduplicate. Consider that the top-selling non-information infomercial products—whether exercise\nequipment or supplements—have a useful life span of two to four months before imitators flood the\nmarket. I studied economics in Beijing for six months and observed firsthand how the latest Nike sneaker\nor Callaway golf club could be duplicated and on eBay within a week of first appearing on shelves in the\nU.S. This is not an exaggeration, and I am not talking about a look-alike product—I mean an exact\nduplicate for 1/20 the cost.\nInformation, on the other hand, is too time-consuming for most knockoff artists to bother with when\nthere are easier products to replicate. It’s easier to circumvent a patent than to paraphrase an entire\ncourse to avoid copyright infringement. Three of the most successful television products of all time—all\nof which have spent more than 300 weeks on the infomercial top-10 bestseller lists—reflect the\ncompetitive and profit margin advantage of information products.\nNo Down Payment (Carlton Sheets)\nAttacking Anxiety and Depression (Lucinda Bassett)\nPersonal Power (Tony Robbins)\nI know from conversations with the principal owners of one of the above products that more than $65\nmillion worth of information moved through their doors in 2002. Their infrastructure consisted of fewer\nthan 25 in-house operators, and the rest of the infrastructure, ranging from media purchasing to shipping,\nwas outsourced.\nTheir annual revenue-per-employee is more than $2.7 million. Incredible.\nOn the opposite end of the market size spectrum, I know a man who created a low-budget how-to\nDVD for less than $200 and sold it to owners of storage facilities who wanted to install security systems.\nIt’s hard to get more niche than that. In 2001, selling DVDs that cost $2 to duplicate for $95 apiece\nthrough trade magazines, he made several hundred thousand dollars with no employees.\nBut I’m Not an Expert!\nIf you aren’t an expert, don’t sweat it.\nFirst, “expert” in the context of selling product means that you know more about the topic than the\npurchaser. No more. It is not necessary to be the best—just better than a small target number of your\nprospective customers. Let’s suppose that your current dreamline—to compete in the 1,150-mile Iditarod\ndogsledding race in Alaska—requires $5,000 to realize. If there are 15,000 readers and even 50 (0.33%)\ncan be convinced of your superior expertise in skill X and spend $100 for a program that teaches it, that\nis $5,000. Bring on the Huskies. Those 50 customers are what I call the “minimal customer base”—the\nminimum number of customers you need to convince of your expertise to fulfill a given dreamline.\nSecond, expert status can be created in less than four weeks if you understand basic credibility\nindicators. It’s important to learn how the PR pros phrase resume points and position their clients. See\nthe boxed text later in this chapter to learn how.\nThe degree to which you personally need expert status also depends on how you obtain your content.\nThere are three main options.\n1. Create the content yourself, often via paraphrasing and combining points from several books on a\ntopic.\n2. Repurpose content that is in the public domain and not subject to copyright protection, such as\ngovernment documents and material that predates modern copyright law.\n3. License content or compensate an expert to help create content. Fees can be one-time and paid up\nfront or royalty-based (5–10% of net revenue, for example).\nIf you choose option 1 or 2, you need expert status within a limited market.\nLet’s assume you are a real estate broker and have determined that, like yourself, most brokers want a\nsimple but good website to promote themselves and their businesses. If you read and understand the three\ntop-selling books on home-page design, you will know more about that topic than 80% of the readership\nof a magazine for real estate brokers. If you can summarize the content and make recommendations\nspecific to the needs of the real estate market, a 0.5–1.5% response from an ad you place in the magazine\nis not unreasonable to expect.\nUse the following questions to brainstorm potential how-to or informational products that can be sold\nto your markets using your expertise or borrowed expertise. Aim for a combination of formats that will\nlend itself to $50–200 pricing, such as a combination of two CDs (30–90 minutes each), a 40-page\ntranscription of the CDs, and a 10-page quickstart guide. Digital delivery is perfectly acceptable—in\nsome cases, ideal—if you can create a high enough perceived value.\n1. How can you tailor a general skill for your market—what I call “niching down”—or add to what is\nbeing sold successfully in your target magazines? Think narrow and deep rather than broad.\n2. What skills are you interested in that you—and others in your markets—would pay to learn? Become\nan expert in this skill for yourself and then create a product to teach the same. If you need help or want\nto speed up the process, consider the next question.\n3. What experts could you interview and record to create a sellable audio CD? These people do not need\nto be the best, but just better than most. Offer them a digital master copy of the interview to do with or\nsell as they like (this is often enough) and/or offer them a small up-front or ongoing royalty payment.\nUse Skype.com with HotRecorder (more on these and related tools in Tools and Tricks) to record these\nconversations directly to your PC and send the mp3 file to an online transcription service.\n4. Do you have a failure-to-success story that could be turned into a how-to product for others? Consider\nproblems you’ve overcome in the past, both professional and personal.\nThe Expert Builder: How to Become a Top Expert in 4 Weeks\nIt’s time to obliterate the cult of the expert. Let the PR world scorn me. First and foremost, there is a\ndifference between being perceived as an expert and being one. In the context of business, the former is\nwhat sells product and the latter, relative to your “minimal customer base,” is what creates good products\nand prevents returns.\nIt is possible to know all there is to know about a subject—medicine, for example—but if you don’t\nhave M.D. at the end of your name, few will listen. The M.D. is what I term a “credibility indicator.” The\nso-called expert with the most credibility indicators, whether acronyms or affiliations, is often the most\nsuccessful in the marketplace, even if other candidates have more in-depth knowledge. This is a matter\nof superior positioning, not deception.\nHow, then, do we go about acquiring credibility indicators in the least time possible? Emulating the\nclient-grooming techniques of some of the best PR firms in New York City and Los Angeles isn’t a bad\nplace to start.\nIt took a friend of mine just three weeks to become a “top relationship expert who, as featured in\nGlamour and other national media, has counseled executives at Fortune 500 companies on how to\nimprove their relationships in 24 hours or less.” How did she do it?\nShe followed a few simple steps that created a credibility snowball effect. Here’s how you can do the\nsame.\n1. Join two or three related trade organizations with official-sounding names. In her case, she\nchose the Association for Conflict Resolution (www.acrnet.org) and The International Foundation for\nGender Education (www.ifge.org). This can be done online in five minutes with a credit card.\n2. Read the three top-selling books on your topic (search historical New York Times bestseller lists\nonline) and summarize each on one page.\n3. Give one free one-to-three-hour seminar at the closest well-known university, using posters to\nadvertise. Then do the same at branches of two well-known big companies (AT&T, IBM, etc.) located\nin the same area. Tell the company that you have given seminars at University X or X College and are\na member of those groups from step 1. Emphasize that you are offering it to them for free to get\nadditional speaking experience outside of academics and will not be selling products or services.\nRecord the seminars from two angles for later potential use as a CD/DVD product.\n4. Optional: Offer to write one or two articles for trade magazines related to your topics, citing\nwhat you have accomplished in steps 1 and 3 for credibility. If they decline, offer to interview a\nknown expert and write the article—it still gets your name listed as a contributor.\n5. Join ProfNet, which is a service that journalists use to find experts to quote for articles. Getting PR\nis simple if you stop shouting and start listening. Use steps 1, 3, and 4 to demonstrate credibility and\nonline research to respond to journalist queries. Done properly, this will get you featured in media\nranging from small local publications to the New York Times and ABC News.\nBecoming a recognized expert isn’t difficult, so I want to remove that barrier now.\nI am not recommending pretending to be something you’re not. I can’t! “Expert” is nebulous mediaspeak\nand so overused as to be indefinable. In modern PR terms, proof of expertise in most fields is\nshown with group affiliations, client lists, writing credentials, and media mentions, not IQ points or\nPh.D.s.\nPresenting the truth in the best light, but not fabricating it, is the name of the game.\nSee you on CNN.\nQ&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS\nFor this hands-on chapter, the Q&A is simple. In fact, it’s more like a Q.\nThe question is, “Did you read the chapter and follow the directions?” If not, do it! Instead of the\nusual Q&A, the end of this chapter and the following two will feature more extensive resources for\ntaking the action steps described in detail in the text.\nCOMFORT CHALLENGE\nFind Yoda (3 Days)\nCall at least one potential superstar mentor per day for three days. E-mail only after attempting a phone\ncall. I recommend calling before 8:30 A.M. or after 6:00 P.M. to reduce run-ins with secretaries and other\ngatekeepers. Have a single question in mind, one that you have researched but have been unable to\nanswer yourself. Shoot for “A” players—CEOs, ultrasuccessful entrepreneurs, famous authors, etc.—and\ndon’t aim low to make it less frightening. Use www.contactanycelebrity.com if need be, and base your\nscript on the following.\nUnknown answerer: This is Acme Inc. [or “the office of Mentor X”].\nYou: Hi, this is Tim Ferriss calling for John Grisham, please. 31\nAnswerer: May I ask what this is regarding?\nYou: Sure. I know this might sound a bit odd, 32 but I’m a first-time author and just read his interview in\nTime Out New York. 33 I’m a longtime 34 fan and have finally built up the courage to 35 call him for one\nspecific piece of advice. It wouldn’t take more than two minutes of his time. Is there any way you can\nhelp me get through to him? 36 I really, really appreciate whatever you can do.\nAnswerer: Hmmm … Just a second.

I know this might sound a bit odd, but I’m a first-time\nauthor and a longtime fan. I just read your interview in Time Out New York and finally built up the\ncourage to call. I have wanted to ask you for a specific piece of advice for a long time, and it shouldn’t\ntake more than two minutes of your time. May I? 37\nJohn Grisham: Uh … OK. Go ahead. I have to be on a call in a few minutes.\nYou (at the very end of the call): Thank you so much for being so generous with your time. If I have the\noccasional tough question—very occasional—is there any chance I could keep in touch via e-mail? 38\nLIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION\nOVER THE MOON\nMy 13-year-old daughter would like to be an astronaut when she grows up. Last year she had an\nextreme challenge to deal with. The phrase from Apollo 13 “Failure is not an option” sort of became our\nmotto. I got the idea of contacting the commander of Apollo 13, Jim Lovell. It didn’t take much to find\nhim and he sent her a wonderful letter about his ordeal just to get into the Apollo program, not to\nmention dealing with a crippled spacecraft. His letter made a big difference to my daughter. A couple\nmonths later, we were able to take things a little further by getting her VIP access to a shuttle launch.\n—ROB\nTOOLS AND TRICKS\nConfirming Sufficient Market Size\nCompete (www.compete.com) and\nQuantcast (www.quantcast.com)\nFind the number of monthly visitors for most websites, in addition to the search terms that generate the\nmost traffic for them.\nWriter’s Market ( www.writersmarket.com )\nHere you’ll find a listing of thousands of specialty and niche magazines, including circulation and\nsubscription numbers.

While I was waiting, I noticed a copy of 4-Hour\nWorkweek on the counter that someone else had ordered. Not one to be shy, I reached over the counter\nand started reading their copy. As you might guess, I had the employee go back and get me my own\ncopy. Haven’t finished Tropic of Cancer but finished your book …\n… On Monday I got a yes when I asked my boss to work two days remotely per week. I start next\nweek.\nOn Monday I also booked the most stunning apartment in Paris for the month of September, at a cost\nof half of the rent I pay in Southern California. I plan to increase my remote time now through August so\nthat September will be an easy ask to leave for remote work. If the answer happens to be no (which I\nnow doubt), I will be prepared to quit my job.\nNow at work on my Income Autopilot project.\nTim: amazing. My life has changed in three days. (Plus, your book was funny as hell.) Thank\nyou!!! —CINDY FRANKEY\n21.

Distributors are sometimes also referred to as “wholesalers,” depending on the industry.\n24. It is illegal to control how much someone sells your product for, but you can dictate how much\nthey advertise it for. This is done by including a Minimum Advertised Pricing (MAP) policy in your\nGeneral Terms and Conditions (GTC), which are agreed to automatically when a written wholesale\norder is placed. Sample GTC and order forms are available at www.fourhourblog.com.\n25. The Wall Street Journal, July 18, 2005 (http://www.technologyinvestor.com/login/2004/Jul18–\n05.php).\n26. This was a new product category that I created to eliminate and preempt the competition. Strive to\nbe the largest, best, or first in a precise category. I prefer being first.\n27. If you decide to resell someone else’s higher-end products like Doug, especially with dropshipping,\nthe risk is lower and smaller margins can suffice.\n28. “Back-end” products are products sold to customers once the sale of a primary product has been\nmade. iPod covers and car GPS systems are two examples. These products can have lower margins,\nbecause there is no advertising cost to acquire the customer.\n29. “Cross-selling” is selling a related product to a customer while they’re still on the phone or in an\nonline shopping cart after the sale of a primary product has been made.

Said casually and with confidence, this alone will get you through surprisingly often. “I’d like to\nspeak with Mr./Ms. X, please” is a dead giveaway that you don’t know them. If you want to up the\nchances of getting though but risk looking foolish if they call the bluff, ask for the target mentor by\nfirst name only.\n32. I use this type of lead-in whenever making off-the-wall requests. It softens it and makes the\nperson curious enough to listen before spitting out an automatic “no.”\n33. This answers the questions they’ll have in their head: “Who are you and why are you calling\nnow?” I like to be a “first-time” something to play the sympathy card, and I find a recent media\nfeature online to cite as the trigger for calling.\n34. I call people I’m familiar with. If you can’t call yourself a longtime fan, tell them that you have\nfollowed the mentor’s career or business exploits for a certain number of years.\n35. Don’t pretend to be strong. Make it clear you’re nervous and they’ll lower their guard. I often do\nthis even if I’m not nervous.\n36. The wording here is critical. Ask them to “help” you do something.\n37. Just rework the gatekeeper paragraph for this, and don’t dillydally—get to the point quickly and\nask for permission to pull the trigger.\n38. End the conversation by opening the door for future contact.

Thus the yeoman work in any science … is done by the experimentalist, who\nmust keep the theoreticians honest.\n—MICHIO KAKU, theoretical physicist and cocreator of String Field Theory, Hyperspace\nFewer than 5% of the 195,000 books published each year sell more than 5,000 copies. Teams of\npublishers and editors with decades of combined experience fail more times than not. The founder of\nBorder’s Books lost $375 million of investor funding with WebVan, 39 a nationwide grocery delivery\nservice. The problem? No one wanted it.\nThe moral is that intuition and experience are poor predictors of which products and businesses will be\nprofitable. Focus groups are equally misleading. Ask ten people if they would buy your product. Then\ntell those who said “yes” that you have ten units in your car and ask them to buy. The initial positive\nresponses, given by people who want to be liked and aim to please, become polite refusals as soon as real\nmoney is at stake.\nTo get an accurate indicator of commercial viability, don’t ask people if they would buy—ask them to\nbuy. The response to the second is the only one that matters. The approach of the NR reflects this.\nStep Three: Micro-Test Your Products\nMicro-testing involves using inexpensive advertisements to test consumer response to a product\nprior to manufacturing. 40\nIn the pre-Internet era, this was done using small classified ads in newspapers or magazines that led\nprospects to call a prerecorded sales message. Prospects would leave their contact information, and based\non the number of callers or response to a follow-up sales letter, the product would be abandoned or\nmanufactured.\nIn the Internet era, there are better tools that are both cheaper and faster. We’ll test the product ideas\nfrom the last chapter on Google Adwords—the largest and most sophisticated Pay-Per-Click (PPC)\nengine—in five days for $500 or less. PPC here refers to the highlighted search results that are listed\nabove and to the right of normal search results on Google. Advertisers pay to have these ads displayed\nwhen people search for a certain term related to the advertisers’ product, such as “cognitive supplement,”\nand are charged a small fee from $.05 to over $1 each time someone clicks through to their site. For a\ngood introduction to Google Adwords and PPC, visit www.google.com/onlinebusiness. For expanded\nexamples of the following PPC strategies, visit www.fourhourblog.com and search “PPC.”\nThe basic test process consists of three parts, each of which is covered in this chapter.\nBest: Look at the competition and create a more-compelling offer on a basic one-to-three-page website\n(one to three hours).\nTest: Test the offer using short Google Adwords advertising campaigns (three hours to set up and five\ndays of passive observation).\nDivest or Invest: Cut losses with losers and manufacture the winner(s) for sales rollout.\nLet’s use two people, Sherwood and Johanna, and their two product ideas—French sailor shirts and a\nhow-to yoga DVD for rock climbers—as case studies of what the testing steps look like and how you\ncan do the same.\nSherwood bought a striped sailing shirt in France while traveling last summer, and upon returning to\nNYC has been continually approached by 20–30-year-old males on the street who want to know where\nto get their own. Sensing an opportunity, he requests back issues of NYC-based weekly magazines\naimed at this demographic and calls the manufacturer in France for pricing. He learns that he can\npurchase shirts at a wholesale price of $20 that sell for $100 retail. He adds $5 per shirt to account for\nshipping to the U.S. and arrives at a per-shirt cost of $25. It’s not quite our ideal markup (4x vs. 8–10x),\nbut he wants to test the product regardless.\nJohanna is a yoga instructor who has noticed her growing client base of rock climbers. She is also a\nrock climber and is considering creating a yoga instructional DVD tailored to that sport, which would\ninclude a 20-page spiral-bound manual and be priced at $80. She predicts that production of a lowbudget\nfirst edition of the DVD would cost nothing more than a borrowed digital camera and a friend’s\niMac for simple editing. She can burn small quantities of this first-edition DVD—no menus, just straight\nfootage and titles—on the laptop and create labels with freeware from www.download.com. She has\ncontacted a duplication house and learned that more-professional DVDs will cost $3–5 apiece to\nduplicate in small quantities (minimum of 250), including cases.\nNow that they have ideas and estimates of start-up costs, what next?\nBesting the Competition\nFirst and foremost, each product must pass a competitive litmus test. How can Sherwood and Johanna\nbeat the competition and offer a superior product or guarantee?\n1. Sherwood and Johanna Google the top terms each would use to try and find their respective products.\nTo come up with related terms and derivative terms, both use search term suggestion tools.\nGoogle Adwords Keyword Tool (http://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal) Enter the\npotential search terms to find search volume and alternative terms with more search traffic. Click on the\n“Approx Avg Search Volume” column to sort results from most to least searched.\nSEOBook Keyword Tool, SEO for Firefox Extension (http://tools.seobook.com/) This is an\noutstanding resource page with searches powered by Wordtracker (www.wordtracker.com).\nBoth then visit the three websites that consistently appear in top search and PPC positions. How can\nSherwood and Johanna differentiate themselves?\nUse more credibility indicators? (media, academia, associations,\nand testimonials)\nCreate a better guarantee?\nOffer better selection? 41\nFree or faster shipping?\nSherwood notices that the shirts are often hard to find on the competitive sites, all of which feature\ndozens of products, and the shirts are either made in the U.S. (inauthentic) or shipped from France\n(customers must wait two to four weeks). Johanna cannot find a “yoga for rock climbing” DVD, so she\nis starting from a blank slate.\n2. Sherwood and Johanna now need to create a one-page (300–600 words) testimonial-rich\nadvertisement that emphasizes their differentiators and product benefits using text and either personal\nphotos or stock photos from stock photo websites. Both have spent two weeks collecting advertisements\nthat have prompted them to make purchases or that have caught their attention in print or online—these\nwill serve as models. 42 Johanna asks her clients for testimonials and Sherwood lets his friends try on the\nshirts to get several for his page. Sherwood also asks the manufacturer for photos and advertising\nsamples.\nSee www.pxmethod.com for a good example of how I have created a test page using testimonials\nfrom seminar attendees. Please note that it’s just a template for readers and not a live sales page. Free\nhow-to seminars as recommended in the Expert Builder are ideal for identifying popular selling points\nand securing testimonials.\nTesting the Advertisement\nSherwood and Johanna now need to test actual customer response to their advertisements. Sherwood first\ntests his concept with a 72-hour eBay auction that includes his advertising text. He sets the “reserve” (the\nlowest price he’ll accept) for one shirt at $50 and cancels the auction last minute to avoid legal issues\nsince he doesn’t have product to ship. He has received bids up to $75 and decides to move to the next\nphase of testing. Johanna doesn’t feel comfortable with the apparent deception and skips this preliminary\ntesting.\nSherwood’s cost: <$5.\nBoth register domain names for their soon-to-be one-page sites using the cheap domain registrar\nwww.domainsinseconds.com. Sherwood chooses www.shirtsfromfrance.com and Johanna chooses\nwww.yogaclimber.com. For additional domain names, Johanna uses www.domainsinseconds.com.\nCost to both: <$20.\nSherwood uses www.weebly.com to create his one-page site advertisement and then creates two\nadditional pages using the form builder www.wufoo.com. If someone clicks on the “purchase” button at\nthe bottom of the first page, it takes them to a second page with pricing, shipping and handling, 43 and\nbasic contact fields to fill out (including e-mail and phone). If the visitor presses “continue with order,” it\ntakes them to a page that states, “Unfortunately, we are currently on back order but will contact you as\nsoon as we have product in stock. Thank you for your patience.” This structure allows him to test the\nfirst-page ad and his pricing separately. If someone gets to the last page, it is considered an order.\nJohanna is not comfortable with “dry testing,” as Sherwood’s approach is known, even though it is\nlegal if the billing data isn’t captured. She instead uses the same two services to create a single webpage\nwith the content of her one-page ad and an e-mail sign-up for a free “top 10 tips” list for using yoga for\nrock climbing. She will consider 60% of the sign-ups as hypothetical orders.\nCost to both: <$0.\nBoth set up simple Google Adwords campaigns with 50–100 search terms to simultaneously test\nheadlines while driving traffic to their pages. Their daily budget limits are set at $50 per day. (At this\nsegue into PPC testing, I recommend you first visit www.adwords/google.com/onlinebusiness and then\nfollow along by creating your own account, which should take about 10 minutes. It would be a waste of\nrain forests to use ten pages to explain terms that can be understood at a glance online.)\nSherwood and Johanna decide on the best search terms by using the search term suggestion tools\nmentioned earlier. Both aim for specific terms when possible (“french sailor shirts” vs. “french shirts;”\n“yoga for sports” vs. “yoga”) for higher conversion rates (the percentage of visitors that purchase) and\nlower cost-per-click (CPC). They aim also for second through fourth positioning, but no more than $.20\nCPC.\nSherwood will use Google’s free analytical tools to track “orders” and page abandonment rates—what\npercentage of visitors leave the site from which pages. Johanna will use www.wufoo.com to track e-mail\nsign-ups on this small testing scale. 44\nCost to both: $0.\nBoth Johanna and Sherwood design Adwords ads that focus on their differentiators. Each Google\nAdwords ad consists of a headline and then two lines of description, neither of which can exceed 35\ncharacters. In Sherwood’s case, he creates five groups of 10 search terms each. The following are two of\nhis ads.\nSAILOR SHIRTS FROM FRANCE\nJohanna creates the same five groups of 10 terms each and tests a number of ads, including these:\nNotice that these ads can be used to test not just headlines but guarantees, product names, and domain\nnames. It’s as simple as creating several ads, rotated automatically by Google, that are identical except\nfor the one variable to be tested. How do you think I determined the best title for this book?\nBoth Sherwood and Johanna disable the feature on Google that serves only the best-performing ad.\nThis is necessary to later compare the click-through rates from each and combine the best elements\n(headline, domain name, and body text) into a final ad.\nLast but not least, ensure that the ads don’t trick prospects into visiting the site. The product offer\nshould be clear. Our goal is qualified traffic, so we do not want to offer something “free” or otherwise\nattract window shoppers or the curious who are unlikely to buy.\nCost to both: $50 or less per day x 5 days = $250. 45\nInvesting or Divesting\nFive days later, it’s time to tally the results.\nWhat can we consider a “good” click-through and conversion rate? This is where the math can be\ndeceiving. If we’re selling a $10,000 abominable snowman suit with an 80% profit margin, we obviously\nneed a much lower conversion rate than someone who is selling a $50 DVD with a 70% profit margin.\nFor sophisticated tools and free spreadsheets that do all sorts of calculations for you, visit the reader-only\nresources at www.fourhourblog.com.\nJohanna and Sherwood decide to keep it simple at this stage: How much did they spend on PPC ads\nand how much did they “sell”?\nJohanna has done well. The traffic wasn’t enough to make the test stand up to statistical scrutiny, but\nshe spent about $200 on PPC and got 14 sign-ups for a free 10-tip report. If she assumes 60% would\npurchase, that means 8.4 people x $75 profit per DVD = $630 in hypothetical total profit. This is also not\ntaking into account the potential lifetime value of each customer.\nThe results of her small test are no guarantee of future success, but the indications are positive enough\nthat she decides to set up a Yahoo Store for $99 per month and a small per-transaction fee. Her credit\nisn’t excellent, so she will opt to use www.paypal.com to accept credit cards online instead of\napproaching her bank for a merchant account. 46 She e-mails the 10-tip report to those who signed up and\nasks for their feedback and recommendations for content on the DVD. Ten days later, she has a first\nattempt at the DVD ready to ship and her store is online. Her sales to the original sign-ups cover costs of\nproduction and she is soon selling a respectable 10 DVDs per week ($750 profit) via Google Adwords.\nShe plans to test advertising in niche magazines and blogs and now needs to create an automation\narchitecture to remove herself from the equation.\nSherwood didn’t fare as well but still sees potential. He spent $150 on PPC and “sold” three shirts for\na hypothetical $225 in profit. He had more than enough traffic, but the bulk of visitors left the site on the\npricing page. Rather than drop pricing, he decides to test a “2x money-back guarantee” on the pricing\npage, which will enable customers to get a $200 refund if the $100 shirts aren’t the “most comfortable\nthey’ve ever owned.” He retests and “sells” seven shirts for $525 in profit. Based on these results, he sets\nup a merchant account through his bank and Authorize.net to process credit cards, orders a dozen shirts\nfrom France, and sells them all over the following ten days. This gives him enough profit to buy a small\ndisplay ad at 50% off (asking for a “first-time advertiser discount” and then citing a competing magazine\nto get another 20% off) in a local weekly art magazine, in which he calls the shirt “Jackson Pollock\nShirts.” He orders two dozen more shirts with net-30 payment terms and puts a toll-free number 47 in the\nprint ad that forwards to his cell phone. He does this instead of using a website for two reasons: (1) He\nwants to determine the most common questions for his FAQ online, and (2) he wants to test an offer of\n$100 for one shirt ($75 in profit) or “buy two, get one free” ($200 - $75 = $125 profit).\nHe sells all 24 shirts in the first five days the magazine runs, most through the special offer. Success.\nHe redesigns the print ad, putting answers to common questions in the text to cut down on calls for\ninformation, and decides to negotiate a longer-term ad agreement with the magazine. He sends his sales\nrep a check for four issues at 30% of their published rates. He calls to confirm that they received his\ncheck via FedEx and, with check in hand and deadlines looming, they don’t refuse.\nSherwood wants to go to Berlin during a two-week break from his job, which he is now considering\nquitting. How can he roll out his success and escape his own company? He needs to build the\narchitecture and get his mobile M.B.A.\nThat’s where the next chapter comes in.\nNew Rich Revisited: How Doug Did It\nRemember Doug from ProSoundEffects.com? How did he test the idea and go from $0 to $10,000\nper month in the process? He followed these steps.\n1. Market Selection\nHe chose music and television producers as his market because he is a musician himself and has used\nthese products.\n2. Product Brainstorm\nHe chose the most popular products available for resale from the largest manufacturers of sound libraries\nand arranged a wholesale purchase and drop-ship agreement with them. Many of these libraries cost well\nabove $300 (up to $7,500), and this is precisely why he needs to answer more customer-service\nquestions than someone with a lower-priced product of $50–200.\n3. Micro-Testing\nHe auctioned the products on eBay to test demand (and the highest possible pricing) before purchasing\ninventory. He ordered product only when people placed orders from him, and product shipped\nimmediately from the manufacturers’ warehouses. Based on this demand confirmed on eBay, Doug\ncreated a Yahoo Store with these products and began testing Google Adwords and other PPC search\nengines.\n4. Rollout and Automation\nFollowing this testing, and upon generating sufficient cash flow, Doug began experimenting with print\nadvertising in trade magazines. Simultaneously, he streamlined and outsourced operations to reduce his\ntime requirements from two hours per day to two hours per week.\nCOMFORT CHALLENGE\nRejecting First Offers and Walking Away (3 Days)\nBefore performing this exercise, if possible, read the bonus chapter “How to Get $700,000 of\nAdvertising for $10,000” on our companion site, and then set aside two hours on a consecutive Saturday,\nSunday, and Monday.\nOn Saturday and Sunday, go to a farmers’ market or other outdoor event where goods are sold. If this\nisn’t possible, go to small independent retailers (not chains or mass retail).\nSet a budget of $100 for your negotiating tuition and look for items to purchase that total at least $150.\nYour job is to get the sellers down to a total of $100 or less for the lot. It is better to practice on many\ncheap items rather than a few big items. Be sure to reply to their first offer with, “What type of discount\ncan you offer?” to let them negotiate against themselves. Negotiate near closing time, choose your\nobjective price, bracket, and make a firm offer with cash in hand for that amount. 48 Practice walking\naway if your objective price isn’t met. On Monday, call two magazines (expect the first to be awkward)\nand use the script on the companion site to negotiate, minus the last firm offer. Get them as low as\npossible and then call them back later to indicate that your proposal was refused by upper management\nor otherwise vetoed.\nThis is the negotiating equivalent of paper trading. 49 Get used to refusing offers and countering in\nperson and—most importantly—on the phone.\nTOOLS AND TRICKS\nSample Muse Test Page\nThe PX Method ( www.pxmethod.com )\nThis sales template was used to determine the viability of a speed-reading product, which tested\nsuccessfully. Notice how testimonials, credibility indicators, and risk-reversal guarantees are used, as\nwell as how the pricing is put on a separate page so it can be isolated as a testing variable. Use this as a\nreference—it is a simple and effective model that can be copied. Please do not input your credit card\ninformation, as it is just a mock-up for teaching purposes.\nFast and Simple Website Creation for Non-Techies (and Techies)\nWeebly ( www.weebly.com )\nWeebly, which the BBC labeled “a must,” allowed me to create www.timothyferriss.com in less than two\nhours and have it appear on the front page of Google for “timothy ferriss” searches within 48 hours. It is,\nlike WordPress.com below, designed to be very SEO-friendly (search-engine optimization) without any\nknowledge or action on your part. No HTML or Internet expertise is required.\nWordPress.com ( www.wordpress.com )\nI used WordPress.com to set up www.litliberation.org from a coffee shop in Bratislava, Slovakia, when a\nU.S.-based designer flaked out and left me scrambling. It took me less than three hours to learn how to\nuse it and build the site. The site, an experimental educational fundraiser, ended up raising 200%+ more\nthan Stephen Colbert in the same period of time. I also use their free open-sourced version of WordPress\n(www.wordpress.org, which requires separate hosting) to manage everything for my top-1,000 blog at\nwww.fourhourblog.com. This offers greater customization but requires more management and technical\nknow-how.\nBoth Weebly and WordPress.com host your site for you, so additional hosting setup isn’t required.\nIf you choose to use www.wordpress.org (not.com) for greater customizability, I suggest using a\nhosting service with one-click WordPress installation like www.bluehost.com. The Shopp plug-in\n(http://shopplugin.net/) or Market Theme plug-in (http://www.markettheme.com/) can then be used to\nadd e-commerce capabilities. Shopify.com (discussed later) is another good all-in-one alternative.\nCreate Forms in Seconds for Testing Checkout with or Without Payment\nWufoo ( www.wufoo.com )\nWufoo does not offer a full-featured shopping cart, but it provides the cleanest, easiest-to-use forms on\nthe web. Create a checkout page that connects to PayPal and you can (1) link to this checkout page from\nyour site on Weebly, WordPress.com, or elsewhere, or (2) drop the code into your own website and have\nit hosted there. Wufoo is appropriate for testing and selling single products, as people can’t add multiple\nitems to a shopping cart or otherwise customize the order à la Amazon. For those additional options,\nwhich are often desirable after successful testing, you will want to use an “end-to-end site solutions”\nlisted later in these resources.\nCost-Effective Trademark Filing and Company Formation (LLC, C-Corp, etc.)\nThough I also have a C-Corporation (often used to issue common and preferred stock to investors),\ncreated through the second option below, LLCs and S-Corps are generally favored by small businesses.\nConsult your accountant to determine the best entity form.\nLegalZoom ( www.legalzoom.com )\nCompany formation, trademarks, and nearly all legal documents. I know one founder who used this\nservice to incorporate his tech start-up, which is now worth more than $200 million.\nCorporate Creations ( www.corporatecreations.com )\nDomestic and overseas company formation.\nServices for Selling Downloadable Products (e-books, videos, audio, etc., in descending order of\nreader preference)\nE-Junkie ( www.e-junkie.com )\nLulu ( www.lulu.com )\nLulu will also do print-on-demand and other forms of manufacture and fulfillment. Like Lightning\nSource (www.lightningsource.com), it offers distribution through Amazon, Barnes & Noble online, and\nother major outlets.\nCreateSpace ( www.createspace.com )\nA subsidiary of Amazon.com that offers inventory-free, physical distribution of books, CD and DVDs on\nDemand, as well as video downloads through Amazon Video On Demand (tm) .\nClickbank ( www.clickbank.com )\nProvides integrated access to affiliates willing to sell your product for a percentage of sales.\nIntroduction to Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Advertising and Testing\nGoogle Adwords ( www.google.com/adwords )\nMarket Sizing and Keyword Suggestion Tools\nBrainstorm additional PPC search terms and determine the number of people who are searching for them.\nGoogle Adwords Keyword Tool ( http://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal )\nEnter the potential search terms to find search volume and alternative terms with more search traffic.\nClick on the “Approx Avg Search Volume” column to sort results from most to least searched.\nSEOBook Keyword Tool, SEO for Firefox Extension ( http://tools.seobook.com /)\nOutstanding resource page with searches powered by Wordtracker (www.wordtracker.com).\nLow-Cost Domain Registration\nDomains in Seconds ( www.domainsinseconds.com ) I have\nregistered more than 100 domains through this service.\nJoker ( www.joker.com )\nGoDaddy ( www.godaddy.com )\nInexpensive but Dependable Hosting Services\nShared hosting solutions, where your site is hosted alongside other sites on a single server, are so cheap\nthat I recommend using two providers, one as a primary and one as a backup. Put your site pages on\neach host and sign up with www.no-ip.com, which can redirect traffic (DNS) to the backup in five\nminutes instead of the usual 24 to 48 hours.\n1and1 ( www.1and1.com )\nBlueHost ( www.bluehost.com )\nRackSpace ( www.rackspace.com ; known for dedicated and\nmanaged servers )\nHosting.com ( www.hosting.com ; known for dedicated and\nmanaged servers )\nRoyalty-Free Photos and Materials\niStockphoto ( www.istockphoto.com )\niStockphoto is the Internet’s original member-generated image and design site, which has more than 4\nmillion photographs, vector illustrations, videos, audio tracks, and Flash files available for use.\nGetty Images ( www.gettyimages.com )\nThis is where the pros go. Stock photos and film of anything for a price. I pay $150–400 for most images\nI use in national print campaigns and the quality is outstanding.\nE-mail Sign-up Tracking and Scheduled Autoresponders\nBoth of these programs can be used to embed e-mail address sign-up forms on your site.\nAWeber ( www.aweber.com )\nMailChimp ( www.mailchimp.com )\nEnd-to-End Site Solutions with Payment Processing\nShopify ( www.shopify.com )\nThis is a reader favorite that, in addition to beautiful design, offers full SEO (search-engine\noptimization), drag-and-drop use, statistics, and product fulfillment through one of their certified\npartners such as Fulfillment by Amazon.com. Clients range from small-business owners to Tesla Motors.\nUnlike with Yahoo and eBay, however, you will need to set up a payment-processing service to accept\npayments from customers. (See below—PayPal is the easiest to integrate.)\nYahoo! Store ( http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/ecommerce ) (866–781–9246)\nThis is what Doug of Pro Sound Effects used. As little as $40 a month with 1.5% per transaction.\neBay Store ( http://pages.ebay.com/storefronts/start.html )\nFrom $15–500 per month, plus eBay fees.\nSimple Payment Processing for Testing Pages, from Least to Most Involved\nPayPal Cart (www.paypal.com; see “merchant”)\nAccept credit card payments in minutes. No monthly fees, 1.9–2.9% of each transaction (called “discount\nrate”) and $0.30 per transaction.\nGoogle Checkout ( http://checkout.google.com/sell )\nGet $10 in free processing for each $1 spent on AdWords; 2% and $0.20 per transaction thereafter.\nRequires that customers have a Google ID, and is thus most useful as a supplement to one of the\naforementioned payment solutions. Be sure to link your Checkout account to your AdWords account to\nreceive credit. Important note: free transaction processing for nonprofits.\nAuthorize.net ( www.authorize.net )\nThe Authorize.Net Payment Gateway can help you accept credit card and electronic check payments\nquickly and affordably. More than 230,000 merchants trust Authorize.net to manage their transactions,\nhelp prevent fraud, and grow their business. The fees per transaction are lower than PayPal or Google\nCheckout, but setup will require a merchant account, covered in the next chapter, and other timeconsuming\napplications. I suggest setting up Authorize.net only after a product has tested successfully\nthrough one of the other two options above.\nSoftware for Understanding Web Traffic (Web Analytics)\nHow are people finding, browsing, and leaving your site? How many prospective customers are being\ndelivered by each PPC ad, and which pages are most popular? These programs tell you all this and more.\nGoogle is free for most low-volume sites—and better than a lot of paid software-and the others cost $30\nand upward per month.\nGoogle Analytics ( www.google.com/analytics )\nCrazyEgg ( www.crazyegg.com )\nI use CrazyEgg to see exactly where people are clicking most and least on homepages and landing pages.\nIt is particularly helpful for repositioning the most important links or buttons to help prompt visitors to\ntake specific next actions. Don’t guess what’s working or not—measure it.\nClicktracks (www.clicktracks.com)\nWebTrends ( www.webtrends.com )\nA/B Testing Software\nTesting is, as you know, the name of the game, but testing all the variables can be confusing. How do\nyou know which combination of headlines, text, and images on your homepage results in the most sales?\nInstead of using one version for a bit, then alternating, which is time-consuming, use software that serves\nup different versions to prospects at random, then does the math for you.\nGoogle Website Optimizer (WO) ( http://www.google.com/websiteoptimizer )\nThis is a free tool that, like Google Analytics, is better than most paid services. I used Google WO to test\nthree potential homepages for www.dailyburn.com and increased sign-ups 19%, then again by more than\n16%.\nOffermatica ( www.offermatica.com )\nVertster.com ( www.vertster.com )\nOptimost ( www.optimost.com )\nLow-Cost Toll-free Numbers\nTollFreeMAX (www.tollfreemax.com) (877–888–8MAX) and Kall8 (www.kall8.com)\nTollFreeMAX and Kall8 both allow you to set up toll-free numbers in 2–5 minutes. Calls can then be\nforwarded to any other numbers, and voicemail and statistics can be managed online or via e-mail.\nChecking Competitive Site Traffic\nWant to see how much traffic your competition is getting and who is linking to them?\nCompete ( www.compete.com )\nQuantcast ( www.quantcast.com )\nAlexa ( www.alexa.com )\nFreelance Designers and Programmers\n99Designs (www.99designs.com) and Crowdspring (www.crowdspring.com)\nI used 99Designs to get an excellent logo for www.litliberation.org in 24 hours for less than $150. I\nsubmitted the concept, more than 50 designers worldwide uploaded their best attempts, which I could\nbrowse, and I chose the best after suggesting a few improvements. From Crowdspring’s site: “Name\nyour price, name your deadline, see entries within hours and be done in just days. The average project\ngets a whopping 68 entries. 25 entries or your money back.”\neLance ( www.elance.com ) (877–435–2623)\nCraigslist ( www.craigslist.org )\nLIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION\nI’m a U.S. citizen and it was impossible for my friends and relatives to track me down by phone. Enter\nSkype In. It’s not new but allows you to lease a fixed U.S. (or other country) phone number which then\nforwards to your Skype account. About $60/year. Within Skype you can then set up call forwarding to\nring you at your local number. You pay the rate as if you were calling from the United States to\nwherever you are. I’ve used this in about 40 countries and it works like a treat. The call quality is usually\ngreat and the convenience is amazing. http://www.skype.com/allfeatures/onlinenumber/. A caveat is to\nalways, ALWAYS get a local SIM card for your unlocked GSM phone. Roaming is for amateurs. A\nlocal SIM also gets you GPRS, Edge, or 3G. Sometimes even free Wifi. Cheers, —TY KROLL\nBasically I try to keep all of my tools online so that if my laptop gets stolen, I can buy a new one and\nhave everything up and running within 24 hours. Here are a few of the tools I use on a regular basis:\nRememberTheMilk.com has been really crucial to me keeping on top of my daily tasks.\nFreshbooks.com for online invoicing\nHighrise (http://www.highrisehq.com/) for online CRM\nDropbox (getdropbox.com) for easy file sharing/automatic backup of critical files while on the\nroad\nTrueCrypt (truecrypt.org) for keeping your laptop data secure while on the road.

It’s a “bug\ntracker” aimed at software development companies, but I use it every day for both personal and\nbusiness tasks. It’s almost like a VA, as you can route your mail through it and it will help you sort\nit and keep track of it. It has great features to track e-mails, and there’s a free version for two users\n(me + VA!). —RB CARTER\nA really useful service is Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. With a small investment in time or money, a\nbusiness that requires hundreds of people doing small bits of defined work becomes possible for\nextraordinarily low work-per-unit costs. Examples include the search for Steve Fosset (literally thousands\nof people looked at satellite photos that would have overwhelmed SAR agencies) and a trouble-ticket\nbusiness that utilizes qualified labor all over the world (see Amazon.com/webservices). I am not an\nowner nor do I have any stake in Amazon—but I have used their services and some are trans forming\nwhen it comes to muse creation. Cheers, —J MARYMEE\nFAST TO MARKET\nThe fastest way to market with a product idea is: Registera.com. Get hosting from dathorn.com [a\ncheap reseller account, like www.domainsinseconds.com]. With two clicks set up a wordpress blog.\nApply a theme to it. Add your content and a buy now button. The buy now button links to an enter e-\nmail address, phone number, etc., page. The user then clicks a continue to PayPal button. This\nautomatically e-mails me their details, but then shows the user a message stating that the link to PayPal\nis currently not working. I use this to determine how many sales I would have achieved. I use Google\nads to drive traffic … I calculate theoretical ROI (ideally using Google analytics). If after a week or two\nI can see a positive ROI that’s worth my effort I create or outsource the creation of the product (emag,\nPDF, whatever). I set it all up with a working link to PayPal, and then retrospectively send a message to\nthe users who already tried to buy. Normally within hours I’ve got all my money back, and the cash\nstarts to roll. An example is the DIY public relations pack at www.mybusinesspr.com.au.

It can be illegal to charge customers prior to shipment—so we will not charge customers—but it is\nstill common practice. Why do so many commercials state “allow three to four weeks for delivery” if\nit only takes three to five days for a shipment to get from New York to California? It gives the\ncompanies time to manufacture product and use customers’ credit card payments to finance it. Clever\nbut often against the law.\n41. This applies to Sherwood and not Johanna.\n42. How did I come up with the most successful BodyQUICK headline (“The Fastest Way to Increase\nPower and Speed Guaranteed”)? I borrowed it from the longest-running, and thus most profitable,\nRosetta Stone headline: “The Fastest Way to Learn a Language Guaranteed. (tm) ” Reinventing the\nwheel is expensive—become an astute observer of what is already working and adapt it. I keep a\nfolder of all print and direct mail advertising that compels me to call a number or visit a website, and\nI use www.delicious.com to bookmark websites that convince me to provide my e-mail address or\nmake a purchase.\n43. Sherwood includes shipping and handling prior to the final order page so that people don’t finalize\nthe order just to confirm total pricing. He wants his “orders” to reflect real orders and not price\ncheckers.\n44. If you are rolling out after a successful test or building a large e-mail database, tools like\nwww.aweber.com in the resources are better at scaling.\n45. Keeping in mind that 100 specific terms at $0.10 per click will perform better than 10 broad terms\nat $1.00 per click, the more you spend, and thus the more traffic you drive, the more statistically valid\nthe results will be. If budget permits, increase the number of related terms and daily expenditure so\nthat the entire PPC test costs $500–1,000.\n46. This is a checking account for receiving credit card payments.\n47. Set this up using services detailed at the end of this chapter and the next.\n48. See the online bonus chapter on www.fourhourblog.com to understand all of these terms in\ncontext.

BENNIS, University of Southern California Professor of Business Administration;\nadviser to Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy\nMost entrepreneurs don’t start out with automation as a goal.

If you are fast on your feet, you’ll notice that I just offered you an eitheror\noption. The good news is that, as usual, there is a third option.\nThe contradictory advice you find in business books and elsewhere usually relates to managing\nemployees—how to handle the human element. Herb tells you to give them a hug, Revson tells you to\nkick them in the balls, and I tell you to solve the problem by eliminating it altogether: Remove the\nhuman element.\nOnce you have a product that sells, it’s time to design a self-correcting business architecture that runs\nitself.\nThe Remote-Control CEO\nThe power of hiding ourselves from one another is mercifully given, for men are wild beasts,\nand would devour one another but for this protection.\n—HENRY WARD BEECHER, U.S. abolitionist and clergyman, “Proverbs from Plymouth Pulpit”\nRURAL PENNSYLVANIA\nIn a 200-year-old stone farmhouse, a quiet “experiment in 21st-century leadership” is proceeding\nexactly as planned. 51 Stephen McDonnell is upstairs in his flip-flops looking at a spreadsheet on his\ncomputer. His company has increased its annual revenue 30% per year since it all began, and he is able\nto spend more time with his three daughters than he ever thought possible.\nThe experiment? As CEO of Applegate Farms, he insists on spending just one day per week at the\ncompany headquarters in Bridgewater, New Jersey. He’s not the only CEO who spends time at home, of\ncourse—there are hundreds who have heart attacks or nervous breakdowns and need time to recover—\nbut there is a huge difference. McDonnell has been doing it for more than 17 years. Rarer still, he started\ndoing it just six months after founding the company.\nThis intentional absence has enabled him to create a process-driven instead of founder-driven\nbusiness. Limiting contact with managers forces the entrepreneur to develop operational rules that enable\nothers to deal with problems themselves instead of calling for help.\nThis isn’t just for small operations. Applegate Farms sells more than 120 organic and natural meat\nproducts to high-end retailers and generates more than $35 million in revenue per year.\nIt is all possible because McDonnell started with the end in mind.\nBehind the Scenes: The Muse Architecture\nOrders are nobody can see the Great Oz! Not nobody, not nohow!\n—GUARDIAN OF THE EMERALD CITY GATES, The Wizard of Oz\nStarting with the end in mind—an organizational map of what the eventual business will look like—is\nnot new.\nInfamous deal-maker Wayne Huizenga copied the org chart of McDonald’s to turn Blockbuster into a\nbillion-dollar behemoth, and dozens of titans have done much the same. In our case, it’s the “end in\nmind” that is different. Our goal isn’t to create a business that is as large as possible, but rather a\nbusiness that bothers us as little as possible. The architecture has to place us out of the information flow\ninstead of putting us at the top of it.\nI didn’t get this right the first time I tried.\nIn 2003, I was interviewed in my home office for a documentary called As Seen on TV. We were\ninterrupted every 20–30 seconds with beeping e-mail notifications, IM pings, and ringing phones. I\ncouldn’t leave them unanswered, because dozens of decisions depended on me. If I didn’t ensure the\ntrains were running on time and put out the fires, no one would.\nThe Anatomy of Automation\nTHE 4-HOUR WORKWEEK VIRTUAL ARCHITECTURE\nSplitting the Pie: Outsourcer Economics\nEach outsourcer takes a piece of the revenue pie. Here is what the general profit-loss might look like\nfor a hypothetical $80 product sold via phone and developed with the help of an expert, who is paid a\nroyalty. I recommend calculating profit margins using higher-than-anticipated expenses. This will\naccount for unforeseen costs (read: screwups) and miscellaneous fees such as monthly reports, etc.\nHow do you factor in advertising cost? If a $1,000 ad or $1,000 in PPC produces 50 sales, my\nadvertising cost per order (CPO) is $20. This makes the actual‘ per-unit profit $40.94.\nI set a new goal after that experience, and when I was interviewed six months later as a follow-up, one\nchange was more pronounced than all others: silence. I had redesigned the business from the ground up\nso that I had no phone calls to answer and no e-mail to respond to.\nI’m often asked how big my company is—how many people I employ full-time. The answer is one.\nMost people lose interest at that point. If someone were to ask me how many people run Brain-\nQUICKEN LLC, on the other hand, the answer is different: between 200 and 300. I am the ghost in the\nmachine. 52\nFrom advertisements—print in this example—to a cash deposit in my bank account, the diagram is\nwhat a simplified version of my architecture looks like, including some sample costs. If you have\ndeveloped a product based on the guidelines in the last two chapters, it will plug into this structure handin-glove.\nWhere am I in the diagram? Nowhere.\nI am not a tollbooth through which anything needs to pass. I am more like a police officer on the side\nof the road who can step in if need be, and I use detailed reports from outsourcers to ensure the cogs are\nmoving as intended. I check reports from fulfillment each Monday and monthly reports from the same\nthe first of each month. The latter reports include orders received from the call center, which I can\ncompare to the call center bills to gauge profit. Otherwise, I just check bank accounts online on the first\nand fifteenth of each month to look for odd deductions. If I find something, one e-mail will fix it, and if\nnot, it’s back to kendo, painting, hiking, or whatever I happen to be doing at the time.\nRemoving Yourself from the Equation: When and How\nThe system is the solution.\n—AT&T\nThe diagram should be your rough blueprint for designing a self-sustaining virtual architecture. There\ncould be differences—more or fewer elements—but the main principles are the same:\n1. Contract outsourcing companies 53 that specialize in one function vs. freelancers whenever\npossible so that if someone is fired, quits, or doesn’t perform, you can replace them without\ninterrupting your business. Hire trained groups of people who can provide detailed reporting and\nreplace one another as needed.\n2. Ensure that all outsourcers are willing to communicate among themselves to solve problems, and\ngive them written permission to make most inexpensive decisions without consulting you first (I\nstarted at less than $100 and moved to $400 after two months).\nHow do you get there? It helps to look at where entrepreneurs typically lose their momentum and stall\npermanently.\nMost entrepreneurs begin with the cheapest tools available, bootstrapping and doing things themselves\nto get up and running with little cash. This isn’t the problem. In fact, it’s necessary so that the\nentrepreneurs can train outsourcers later. The problem is that these same entrepreneurs don’t know when\nand how to replace themselves or their homemade infrastructure with something more scalable.\nBy “scalable,” I mean a business architecture that can handle 10,000 orders per week as easily as it can\nhandle 10 orders per week. Doing this requires minimizing your decision-making responsibilities, which\nachieves our goal of time freedom while setting the stage for doubling and tripling income with no\nchange in hours worked.\nCall the companies at the end of the chapter to research costs. Plan and budget accordingly to upgrade\ninfrastructure at the following milestones, which I measure in units of product shipped:\nPhase I: 0–50 Total Units of Product Shipped\nDo it all yourself. Put your phone number on the site for both general questions and order-taking—this is\nimportant in the beginning—and take customer calls to determine common questions that you will\nanswer later in an online FAQ. This FAQ will also be the main material for training phone operators and\ndeveloping sales scripts.\nIs PPC, an offline advertisement, or your website too vague or misleading, thus attracting unqualified\nand time-consuming consumers? If so, change them to answer common questions and make the product\nbenefits (including what it isn’t or doesn’t do) clearer.\nAnswer all e-mail and save your responses in one folder called “customer service questions.” CC\nyourself on responses and put the nature of the customers’ questions in the subject lines for future\nindexing. Personally pack and ship all product to determine the cheapest options for both. Investigate\nopening a merchant account from your local small bank (easier to get than with a larger bank) for later\noutsourced credit card processing at higher roll-out volumes.\nPhase II: >10 Units Shipped Per Week\nAdd the extensive FAQ to your website and continue to add answers to common questions as received.\nFind local fulfillment companies in the yellow pages under “fulfillment services” or “mailing services.”\nIf you cannot find one there or at www.mfsanet.org, call local printers and ask them for\nrecommendations. Narrow the field to those (often the smallest) who will agree not to charge you setup\nfees and monthly minimums. If this isn’t possible, ask for at least 50% off both and then request that the\nsetup fee be applied as an advance against shipping or their other fees.\nLimit the candidates further to those who can respond to order status e-mail (ideal) or phone calls\nfrom customers. The e-mail from your “customer service” folder will be provided as copy-and-paste\nresponses, especially those related to order status and refund requests. 54\nTo lower or eliminate miscellaneous fees, explain that you are a start-up and that your budget is small.\nTell them you need the cash for advertising that will drive more shipments. If needed, mention the\ncompetitive companies that you are considering and pit them against one another, using lower pricing or\nconcessions from one to get larger discounts and bonuses from the others.\nBefore making your final selection, ask for at least three client references and use the following to\nelicit the negatives: “I understand they’re good, but everyone has weaknesses. If you had to point out\nwhere you’ve had some issues and what they’re not the best at, what would you say? Can you please\ndescribe an incident or a disagreement? I expect these with all companies, so it’s no big deal, and it’s\nconfidential, of course.”\nAsk for “net-30 terms”—payment for services 30 days after they’re rendered—after one month of\nprompt payment for their services. It is easier to negotiate all of the above points with smaller operations\nthat need the business. Have your contract manufacturer ship product directly to the fulfillment house\nonce you have decided on one and put the fulfillment house’s e-mail (you can use an e-mail address at\nyour domain and forward it) or phone number on the online “thank you” page for order status questions.\nPhase III: >20 Units Shipped Per Week\nNow you will have the cash flow to afford the setup fees and the monthly minimums that bigger, more\nsophisticated outsourcers will ask for. Call the end-to-end fulfillment houses that handle it all—from\norder status to returns and refunds. Interview them about costs and ask them for referrals to call centers\nand credit card processors they’ve collaborated with for file transfers and problem solving. Don’t\nassemble an architecture of strangers—there will be programming costs and mistakes, both of which are\nexpensive.\nSet up an account with the credit card processor first, for which you will need your own merchant\naccount. This is critical, as the fulfillment house can only handle refunds and declined cards for\ntransactions they process themselves through an outsourced credit card processor.\nOptionally, set up an account with one of the call centers your new fulfillment center recommends.\nThese will often have toll-free numbers you can use instead of purchasing your own. Look at the\npercentage split of online to phone orders during testing and consider carefully if the extra revenue from\nthe latter is worth the hassle. It often isn’t. Those who call to order will generally order online if given no\nother option.\nBefore signing on with a call center, get several 800 numbers they answer for current clients and make\ntest calls, asking difficult product-related questions and gauging sales abilities. Call each number at least\nthree times (morning, afternoon, and evening) and note the make-or-break factor: wait time. The phone\nshould be answered within three to four rings, and if you are put on hold, the shorter the wait the better.\nMore than 15 seconds will result in too many abandoned calls and waste advertising dollars.\nThe Art of Undecision: Fewer Options = More Revenue\nCompanies go out of business when they make the wrong decisions or, just as important, make\ntoo many decisions. The latter creates complexity.\n—MIKE MAPLES, cofounder of Motive Communications (IPO to $260 million market cap),\nfounding executive of Tivoli (sold to IBM for $750 million), and investor in companies such as\nDigg.com\nJoseph Sugarman is the marketing genius behind dozens of direct-response and retail successes,\nincluding the BluBlocker sunglasses phenomenon. Prior to his string of home runs on television (he sold\n20,000 pairs of BluBlockers within 15 minutes of his first QVC appearance), his domain was print media,\nwhere he made millions and built an empire called JS&A Group. He was once recruited to design an\nadvertisement for a manufacturer’s watch line. The manufacturer wanted to feature nine different\nwatches in the ad, and Joe recommended featuring just one. The client insisted and Joe offered to do\nboth and test them in the same issue of The Wall Street Journal. The result? The one-watch offer outsold\nthe nine-watch offer 6-to-1. 55\nHenry Ford once said, referring to his Model-T, the bestselling car of all time, 56 “The customer can\nhave any color he wants, so long as it’s black.” He understood something that businesspeople seem to\nhave forgotten: Serving the customer (“customer service”) is not becoming a personal concierge and\ncatering to their every whim and want. Customer service is providing an excellent product at an\nacceptable price and solving legitimate problems (lost packages, replacements, refunds, etc.) in the fastest\nmanner possible. That’s it.\nThe more options you offer the customer, the more indecision you create and the fewer orders you\nreceive—it is a disservice all around. Furthermore, the more options you offer the customer, the more\nmanufacturing and customer service burden you create for yourself.\nThe art of “undecision” refers to minimizing the number of decisions your customers can or need to\nmake. Here are a few methods that I and other NR have used to reduce service overhead 20–80%:\n1. Offer one or two purchase options (“basic” and “premium,” for example) and no more.\n2. Do not offer multiple shipping options. Offer one fast method instead and charge a premium.\n3. Do not offer overnight or expedited shipping (it is possible to refer them to a reseller who does, as\nis true with all of these points), as these shipping methods will produce hundreds of anxious phone\ncalls.\n4. Eliminate phone orders completely and direct all prospects to online ordering. This seems\noutrageous until you realize that success stories like Amazon.com have depended on it as a\nfundamental cost-saver to survive and thrive.\n5. Do not offer international shipments. Spending 10 minutes per order filling out customs forms and\nthen dealing with customer complaints when the product costs 20–100% more with tariffs and\nduties is about as fun as headbutting a curb. It’s about as profitable, too.\nSome of these policies hint at what is perhaps the biggest time-saver of all: customer filtering.\nNot All Customers Are Created Equal\nOnce you reach Phase III and have some cash flow, it’s time to re-evaluate your customers and thin\nthe herd. There are good and bad versions of all things: good food, bad food; good movies, bad movies;\ngood sex, bad sex; and, yes, good customers and bad customers.\nDecide now to do business with the former and avoid the latter. I recommend looking at the customer\nas an equal trading partner and not as an infallible blessing of a human being to be pleased at all costs. If\nyou offer an excellent product at an acceptable price, it is an equal trade and not a begging session\nbetween subordinate (you) and superior (customer). Be professional but never kowtow to unreasonable\npeople.\nInstead of dealing with problem customers, I recommend you prevent them from ordering in the first\nplace.\nI know dozens of NR who don’t accept Western Union or checks as payment. Some would respond to\nthis with, “You’re giving up 10–15% of your sales!” The NR, in turn, would say, “I am, but I’m also\navoiding the 10–15% of the customers who create 40% of the expenses and eat 40% of my time.” It’s\nclassic 80/20.\nThose who spend the least and ask for the most before ordering will do the same after the sale. Cutting\nthem out is both a good lifestyle decision and a good financial decision. Low-profit and highmaintenance\ncustomers like to call operators and spend up to 30 minutes on the phone asking questions\nthat are unimportant or answered online, costing—in my case—$24.90 (30 x $0.83) per 30-minute\nincident, eliminating the minuscule profit they contribute in the first place.\nThose who spend the most complain the least. In addition to our premium $50–200 pricing, here are a\nfew additional policies that attract the high-profit and low-maintenance customers we want:\n1. Do not accept payment via Western Union, checks, or money order.\n2. Raise wholesale minimums to 12–100 units and require a tax ID number to qualify resellers who\nare real businesspeople and not time-intensive novices. Don’t run a personal business school.\n3. Refer all potential resellers to an online order form that must be printed, filled out, and faxed in.\nNever negotiate pricing or approve lower pricing for higher-volume orders. Cite “company policy”\ndue to having had problems in the past.\n4. Offer low-priced products (à la MRI’s NO2 book) instead of free products to capture contact\ninformation for follow-up sales. Offering something for free is the best way to attract time-eaters\nand spend money on those unwilling to return the favor.\n5. Offer a lose-win guarantee (see boxed text) instead of free trials.\n6. Do not accept orders from common mail fraud countries such as Nigeria.\nMake your customer base an exclusive club, and treat the members well once they’ve been accepted.\nThe Lose-Win Guarantee—How to Sell Anything to Anyone\nIf you want a guarantee, buy a toaster.\n—CLINT EASTWOOD\nThe 30-day money-back guarantee is dead. It just doesn’t have the pizzazz it once did. If a product\ndoesn’t work, I’ve been lied to and will have to spend an afternoon at the post office to return it. This\ncosts me more than just the price I paid for the product, both in time and actual postage. Risk elimination\njust isn’t enough.\nThis is where we enter the neglected realm of lose-win guarantees and risk reversal. The NR use what\nmost consider an afterthought—the guarantee—as a cornerstone sales tool.\nThe NR aim to make it profitable for the customer even if the product fails. Lose-win guarantees not\nonly remove risk for the consumer but put the company at financial risk.\nHere are a few examples of putting your money where your mouth is.\nDelivered in 30 minutes or less or it’s free!\n(Domino’s Pizza built its business on this guarantee.)\nWe’re so confident you’ll like CIALIS, if you don’t we’ll pay for the brand of your choice.\n(The “CIALIS® Promise Program” offers a free sample of CIALIS and then offers to pay for\ncompeting products if CIALIS doesn’t live up to the hype.)\nIf your car is stolen, we’ll pay $500 of your insurance deductible.\n(This guarantee helped THE CLUB become the #1-selling mechanical automobile anti-theft device in\nthe world.)\n110% guaranteed to work within 60 minutes of the first dose.\n(This was for BodyQUICK and a first among sports nutrition products. I offered to not only refund\ncustomers the price of the product if it didn’t work within 60 minutes of the first dose, but also to send\nthem a check for 10% more.)\nThe lose-win guarantee might seem like a big risk, especially when someone can abuse it for profit like\nin the BodyQUICK example, but it isn’t … if your product delivers. Most people are honest.\nLet’s look at some actual numbers.\nReturns for BodyQUICK, even with a 60-day return period (and partially because of it 57 ), are less\nthan 3% in an industry in which the average is 12–15% for a normal 30-day 100% money-back\nguarantee. Sales increased more than 300% within four weeks of introducing the 110% guarantee, and\nreturns decreased overall.\nJohanna adopted this lose-win offer and came up with “Increase sport-specific flexibility 40% in two\nweeks or return it for a full refund (including shipping) and keep the 20-minute bonus DVD as our gift.”\nSherwood found his guarantee as well: “If these shirts are not the most comfortable you’ve ever worn,\nreturn them and get 2-times your purchase price back. Each shirt is also guaranteed for life—if it gets\nthreadbare, send it back and we’ll replace it free of charge.”\nBoth of them increased sales more than 200% in the first two months. Return percentage remained the\nsame for Johanna and increased 50% for Sherwood, from 2 to 3%. Disaster? Far from it. Instead of\nselling 50 and getting one back with a 100% guarantee [(50 x $100) – $100 = $4,900 in revenue], he sold\n200 and got six back with the 200% guarantee [(200 x $100) – (6 x $200) = $18,800 in revenue]. I’ll take\nthe latter.\nLose-win is the new win-win. Stand out and reap the rewards.\nLittle Blue Chip: How to Look Fortune 500 in 45 Minutes\nAre you tired of sand being kicked in your face? I promise you new muscles in days!\n—CHARLES ATLAS, strongman who sold more than $30 million worth of “dynamic-tension”\nmuscle courses through comic books\nIf approaching large resellers or potential partners, small company size will be an obstacle. This\ndiscrimination is often as insurmountable as it is unfounded. Fortunately, a few simple steps can\ndramatically upgrade your budding Fortune 500 image and take your muse from coffee shop to\nboardroom in 45 minutes or less.\n1. Don’t be the CEO or founder.\nBeing the “CEO” or “Founder” screams start-up. Give yourself the mid-level title of “vice president”\n(VP), “director,” or something similar that can be added to depending on the occasion (Director of\nSales, Director of Business Development, etc.). For negotiation purposes as well, remember that it is\nbest not to appear to be the ultimate decision-maker.\n2. Put multiple e-mail and phone contacts on the website.\nPut various e-mail addresses on the “contact us” page for different departments, such as “human\nresources,” “sales,” “general inquiries,” “wholesale distribution,” “media/PR,” “investors,” “web\ncomments,” “order status,” and so on. In the beginning, these will all forward to your e-mail address.\nIn Phase III, most will forward to the appropriate outsourcers. Multiple toll-free numbers can be used\nin the same fashion.\n3. Set up an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) remote receptionist.\nIt is possible to sound like a blue chip for less than $30. In fewer than ten minutes on a site such as\nwww.angel.com, which boasts clients such as Reebok and Kellog’s, it is possible to set up an 800\nnumber that greets callers with a voice prompt such as, “Thank you for calling [business name].\nPlease say the name of the person or department you would like to reach or just hold on for a list of\noptions.”\nUpon speaking your name or selecting the appropriate department, the caller is forwarded to your\npreferred phone or the appropriate outsourcer—with on-hold music and all.\n4. Do not provide home addresses.\nDo not use your home address or you will get visitors. Prior to securing an end-to-end fulfillment\nhouse that can handle checks and money orders—if you decide to accept them—use a post office box\nbut leave out the “PO Box” and include the street address of the post office itself. Thus “PO Box 555,\nNowhere, US 11936” becomes “Suite 555, 1234 Downtown Ave., US 11936.”\nGo forth and project professionalism with a well-designed image. Perceived size does matter.\nCOMFORT CHALLENGE\nRelax in Public (2 days)\nThis is the last Comfort Challenge, placed prior to the chapter that tackles the most uncomfortable\nturning point for most office dwellers: negotiating remote work agreements. This challenge is intended to\nbe fun while showing—in no uncertain terms—that the rules most follow are nothing more than social\nconventions. There are no legal boundaries stopping you from creating an ideal life … or just being selfentertained\nand causing mass confusion.\nSo, relaxing in public. Sounds easy, right? I’m somewhat famous for relaxing in style to get a laugh\nout of friends. Here is the deal, and I don’t care if you’re male or female, 20 or 60, Mongolian or\nMartian. I call the following a “time-out.”\nOnce per day for two days, simply lie down in the middle of a crowded public place at some point.\nLunchtime is ideal. It can be a well-trafficked sidewalk, the middle of a popular Starbucks, or a popular\nbar. There is no real technique involved. Just lie down and remain silent on the ground for about ten\nseconds, and then get up and continue on with whatever you were doing before. I used to do this at\nnightclubs to clear space for break-dancing circles. No one responded to pleading, but going catatonic on\nthe ground did the trick.\nDon’t explain it at all. If someone asks about it after the fact (he or she will be too confused to ask you\nwhile you’re doing it for 10 seconds), just respond, “I just felt like lying down for a second.” The less\nyou say, the funnier and more gratifying this will be. Do it on solo missions for the first two days, and\nthen feel free to do it when with a group of friends. It’s a riot.\nIt isn’t enough to think outside the box. Thinking is passive. Get used to acting outside the box.\nTOOLS AND TRICKS\nLooking Huge—Virtual Receptionist and IVR\nAngel ( www.angel.com )\nGet an 800 number with professional voice menu (voice recognition departments, extensions, etc.) in five\nminutes.

Interview each\nprovider you consider to understand the options and costs involved.\nThe former is a good option if you give the product price in an advertisement (hard offer), are offering\nfree information (lead generation), or don’t need trained salespeople who can overcome objections. In\nother words, your ad or website is pre-qualifying prospects.\nThe latter would more appropriately be called “sales centers.” Operators are commissioned and trained\n“closers” whose sole goal is to convert callers to buyers. These calls are often in response to “call for\ninformation/ trial/sample” ads that don’t feature a price (soft offers). Expect higher costs per sale.\nLiveOps ( www.liveops.com )\nPioneer in home-based reps, which often ensures more calls are answered. Provides comprehensive\nservice with agents, IVR, and Spanish. Often used for one-step order taking instead of soft offers.\nWest Teleservices ( www.west.com )\n29,000 employees worldwide, processes billions of minutes per year. All the high-volume and low-price\nplayers use them for lower-priced products or higher-end products with free trials and installment plans.\nNexRep ( www.nexrep.com )\nHighly skilled home-based sales agents that specialize in B2C and B2B, inbound and outbound\nprograms. If performance, speed to respond, Internet integration, and quality customer experience are\nyour priorities, this is a strong option to consider.\nTriton Technology ( www.tritontechnology.com )\nCommission-only sales center know for incredible closing abilities (see the movie Boiler Room and Alec\nBaldwin’s character in Glengarry, Glen Ross). Don’t call unless your product sells for at least $100.\nCenterPoint Teleservices ( http://www.centerpointllc.com )\nThis sales force has experience to convert sales from hard offers, soft offers, and multiple offers\n(upselling additional products after a caller agrees to purchase the advertised product) originating from\nradio, TV, print, or the web.\nStewart Response Group ( www.stewartresponsegroup.com )\nSales-driven call center leveraging the home-agent model for both inbound and outbound programs.\nAnother high-touch boutique center.\nCredit Card Processors (merchant account through your bank necessary)\nThese companies, unlike options in the last chapter, specialize in not only processing credit cards but\ninteracting with fulfillment on your behalf, removing you from the flowchart.\nTransFirst Payment Processing ( www.transfirst.com )\nChase Paymentech ( www.paymentech.com )\nTrust Commerce ( www.trustcommerce.com )\nPowerPay (www.powerpay.biz)\nOne of the Inc. 500 Fastest-Growing Private Companies.

To save a lot of headache and expense, consider using ad agencies that\nnegotiate discounts of up to 90% in their chosen media.\nManhattan Media (Print) ( www.manhmedia.com )\nGreat agency with fast turnaround.

This is more expensive per order if you have a successful campaign, but it\nlowers upfront investment in media.\nMarketing Architects (Radio) ( www.marketingarchitects.com )\nThe de facto leaders in radio DR but a bit on the expensive side.

However, since the rest of the book was “spot on,” I decided to try it. Rather than ship my money\noverseas, I opted to keep it in the U.S. and use my niece in college, with skills on computers I can’t even\nfathom, to test the theory. Turns out it has been a great experience and timesaver for me, as well as\nmoneymaker for her. It seems I have all of the positives of out sourcing but none of the hassles of\nlanguage and such…. Being able to mold a young mind for the better ties in well with the rest of your\nbook …\n—KEN D.\nHey Tim, You mentioned www.weebly.com a few months ago, and I’ve been using that to build all\nmy muse sites and think it’s great! Also, Facebook groups has (almost) every niche imaginable. So what\nI have found success in doing is: (1) Finding a niche group that would buy my muse, (2) sending a\nmessage to each admin telling them how my muse will help their group members. Then politely asking\nthem to put a blurb in the “Recent News” section of the group. This makes it more trustworthy than a\nwall post, and it stays up there (free advertising) until the admin removes it. One hundred times better\nthan a wall post. In one case, the admin purchased my muse, posted my note for me on the groups’\n“Recent News” section, then e-mailed the entire group telling them they have to check out my site.\n—GAVIN\n50.

JEAN–BAPTISTE–MARIE VIANNEY, Catholic saint, “Curé d’Ars”\nPALO ALTO , CALIFORNIA\n“We’re not going to expense the phone.”\n“I’m not asking you to.”\nSilence. Then a nod, a laugh, and a crooked smile of resignation.\n“OK, then—it’s fine.”\nAnd that was that, lickity-split. Forty-four-year old Dave Camarillo, lifelong employee, had cracked\nthe code and started his second life.\nHe hadn’t been fired; he hadn’t been yelled at. His boss seemed to be handling the whole situation\nquite well. Granted, Dave delivered the goods on the job, and it wasn’t like he was doing naked snow\nangels in client meetings, but still—he had just spent 30 days in China without telling anyone.\n“It wasn’t half as hard as I thought it would be.”\nDave works among more than 10,000 employees at Hewlett- Packard (HP), and—against all odds—he\nactually likes it. He has no desire to start his own company and has spent the last seven years doing tech\nsupport for customers in 45 states and 22 countries. Six months ago, however, he had a small problem.\nShe measured 5′2″ and weighed 110 pounds.\nWas he, like most men, afraid of commitment, unwilling to stop running around the house in Spider-\nMan underoos, or inseparable from the last refuge of any self-respecting man, the PlayStation? No, he\nwas past all that. In fact, Dave was locked and loaded, ready to pop the big question, but he was short on\nvacation days and his girlfriend lived out of town. Waaaaay out of town—5,913 miles out of town.\nHe had met her on a client visit to Shenzhen, China, and it was now time to meet the parents, logistics\nbe damned.\nDave had only recently begun to take tech calls at home, and, well, isn’t home where the heart is? One\nplane ticket and one T-Mobile GSM tri-band phone later, he was somewhere over the Pacific en route to\nhis first seven-day experiment. Twelve time zones hence, he proposed, she accepted, and no one was the\nwiser stateside.\nThe second field trip was a 30-day tour of Chinese family and food (pig face, anyone?), ending with\nShumei Wu becoming Shumei Camarillo. Back in Palo Alto, HP continued its quest for world\ndomination, neither knowing nor caring where Dave was. He had his calls forwarded to his newly\nbegotten wife’s cell phone and all was right in the world.\nNow back in the U.S. after hoping for the best and preparing for the worst, Dave had earned his Eagle\nScout mobility badge. The future looks flexible, indeed. He is going to start by spending two months in\nChina every summer and then move to Australia and Europe to make up for lost time, all with the full\nsupport of his boss.\nThe key to cutting the leash was simple—he asked for forgiveness instead of permission.\n“I didn’t travel for 30 years of my life—so why not?”\nTHAT’S PRECISELY THE question everyone should be asking—why the hell not?\nFrom Caste to Castaway\nThe old rich, the upper class of yore with castles and ascots and irritating little lapdogs, are\ncharacterized as being well-established in one place. The Schwarzes of Nantucket and the McDonnells\nof Charlottesville. Blech. Summers in the Hamptons is sooooo 1990s.\nThe guard is changing. Being bound to one place will be the new defining feature of middle class. The\nNew Rich are defined by a more elusive power than simple cash—unrestricted mobility. This jet-setting\nis not limited to start-up owners or freelancers. Employees can pull it off, too. 58\nNot only can they pull it off, but more and more companies want them to pull it off. BestBuy, the\nconsumer electronics giant, is now sending thousands of employees home from their HQ in Minnesota\nand claims not only lowered costs, but also a 10–20% increase in results. The new mantra is this: Work\nwherever and whenever you want, but get your work done.\nIn Japan, a three-piece zombie who joins the 9–5 grind each morning is called a sarari-man\n—salaryman—and, in the last few years, a new verb has emerged: datsu-sara suru, to escape (datsu) the\nsalaryman (sara) lifestyle.\nIt’s your turn to learn the datsu-sara dance. 59\nTrading Bosses for Beer: An Oktoberfest Case Study\nTo create the proper leverage to be unshackled, we’ll do two things: demonstrate the business benefit\nof remote working and make it too expensive or excruciating to refuse a request for it.\nRemember Sherwood?\nHis French shirts are beginning to move and he is itching to ditch the U.S. for a global walkabout. He\nhas more than enough cash now but needs to escape constant supervision in the office before he can\nimplement all the timesaving tools from Elimination and travel.\nHe is a mechanical engineer and is producing twice as many designs in half the time since erasing\n90% of his time-wasters and interruptions. This quantum leap in performance has been noticed by his\nsupervisors and his value to the company has increased, making it more expensive to lose him. More\nvalue means more leverage for negotiations. Sherwood has been sure to hold back some of his\nproductivity and efficiency so that he can highlight a sudden jump in both during a remote work trial\nperiod.\nSince eliminating most of his meetings and in-person discussions, he has naturally moved about 80%\nof all communication with his boss and colleagues to e-mail and the remaining 20% to phone. Not only\nthis, but he has used tips from chapter 7, “Interrupting Interruption and the Art of Refusal,” to cut\nunimportant and repetitive e-mail volume in half. This will make the move to remote less noticeable, if at\nall noticeable, from a managerial standpoint. Sherwood is running at full speed with less and less\nsupervision.\nSherwood implements his escape in five steps, beginning on July 12 during the slow business season\nand lasting two months, ending with a trip to Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany, for two weeks as a final\ntest before bigger and bolder vagabonding plans.\nStep 1: Increase Investment\nFirst, he speaks with his boss on July 12 about additional training that might be available to employees.\nHe proposes having the company pay for a four-week industrial design class to help him better interface\nwith clients, being sure to mention the benefit to the boss and business (i.e., he’ll decrease\nintradepartmental back-and-forth and increase both client results and billable time). Sherwood wants the\ncompany to invest as much as possible in him so that the loss is greater if he quits.\nStep 2: Prove Increased Output Offsite\nSecond, he calls in sick the next Tuesday and Wednesday, July 18 and 19, to showcase his remote\nworking productivity. 60 He decides to call in sick between Tuesday and Thursday for two reasons: It\nlooks less like a lie for a three-day weekend and it also enables him to see how well he functions in\nsocial isolation without the imminent reprieve of the weekend. He ensures that he doubles his work\noutput on both days, leaves an e-mail trail of some sort for his boss to notice, and keeps quantifiable\nrecords of what he accomplished for reference during later negotiations. Since he uses expensive CAD\nsoftware that is only licensed on his office desktop, Sherwood installs a free trial of GoToMyPC remote\naccess software so that he can pilot his office computer from home.\nStep 3: Prepare the Quantifiable Business Benefit\nThird, Sherwood creates a bullet-point list of how much more he achieved outside the office with\nexplanations. He realizes that he needs to present remote working as a good business decision and not a\npersonal perk. The quantifiable end result was three more designs per day than his usual average and\nthree total hours of additional billable client time. For explanations, he identifies removal of commute\nand fewer distractions from office noise.\nStep 4: Propose a Revocable Trial Period\nFourth, fresh off completing the comfort challenges from previous chapters, Sherwood confidently\nproposes an innocent one-day-per-week remote work trial period for two weeks. He plans a script in\nadvance but does not make it a PowerPoint presentation or otherwise give it the appearance of something\nserious or irreversible. 61\nSherwood knocks on his boss’s office door around 3 P.M. on a relatively relaxed Thursday, July 27,\nthe week after his absence, and his script looks like the following. Stock phrases are underlined and\nfootnotes explain negotiating points.\nSherwood: Hi, Bill. Do you have a quick second?\nBill: Sure. What’s up?\nSherwood: I just wanted to bounce an idea off of you that’s been on my mind. Two minutes should be\nplenty.\nBill: OK. Shoot.\nSherwood: Last week, as you know, I was sick. Long story short, I decided to work at home despite\nfeeling terrible. So here’s the funny part. I thought I would get nothing done, but ended up finishing three\nmore designs than usual on both days. Plus, I put in three more billable hours than usual without the\ncommute, office noise, distractions, etc. OK, so here’s where I’m going. Just as a trial, I’d like to\npropose working from home Mondays and Tuesdays for just two weeks. You can veto it whenever you\nwant, and I’ll come in if we need to do meetings, but I’d like to try it for just two weeks and review the\nresults. I’m 100% confident that I’ll get twice as much done. Does that seem reasonable?\nBill: Hmm … What if we need to share client designs?\nSherwood: There’s a program called GoToMyPC that I used to access the office computer when I was\nsick. I can view everything remotely, and I’ll have my cell phone on me 24/7. Sooooo … What do you\nthink? Test it out starting next Monday and see how much more I get done? 62\nBill: Ummm … OK, fine. But it’s just a test. I have a meeting in five and have to run, but let’s talk\nsoon.\nSherwood: Great. Thanks for the time. I’ll keep you posted on it all. I’m sure you’ll be pleasantly\nsurprised.\nSherwood didn’t expect to get two days per week approved. He asked for two so that, in the case his\nboss refused, he could ask for just one as a fallback position (bracketing). Why didn’t Sherwood go for\nfive days remote per week? Two reasons. First, it’s a lot for management to accept off the bat. We need\nto ask for an inch and turn it into a foot without setting off panic alarms. Second, it is a good idea to\nhone your remote-working abilities—rehearse a bit—before shooting for the big time, as it decreases the\nlikelihood of crises and screwups that will get remote rights revoked.\nStep 5: Expand Remote Time\nSherwood ensures that his days outside of the office are his most productive to date, even minimally\ndropping in-office production to heighten the contrast. He sets a meeting to discuss the results with his\nboss on August 15 and prepares a bullet-point page detailing increased results and items completed\ncompared to in-office time. He suggests upping the ante to four days per week remote for a two-week\ntrial, fully prepared to concede to three days if need be.\nSherwood: It really turned out even better than I expected. If you look at the numbers, it makes a lot of\nbusiness sense, and I’m enjoying work a lot more now. So, here we are. I’d like to suggest, if you think it\nmakes sense, that I try four days a week for another two-week trial. I was thinking that coming in\nFriday 63 would make sense to prepare for the coming week, but we could do whichever day you prefer.\nBill: Sherwood, I’m really not sure we can do that.\nSherwood: What’s your main concern? 64\nBill: It seems like you’re on your way out. I mean, are you going to quit on us? Second, what if everyone\nwants to do the same?\nSherwood: Fair enough. Good points. 65 First, to be honest, I was close to quitting before, with all the\ninterruptions and commute and whatnot, but I’m actually feeling great now with the change in routine. 66\nI’m doing more and feel relaxed for a change. Second, no one should be allowed to work remotely unless\nthey can show increased productivity, and I’m the perfect experiment. If they can show it, however, why\nnot let them do it on a trial basis? It lowers costs for the office, increases productivity, and makes\nemployees happier. So, what do you say? Can I test it out for two weeks and come in Fridays to take care\nof the office stuff? I’ll still document everything, and you, of course, have the right to change your mind\nat any point.\nBill: Man, you are an insistent one. OK, we’ll give it a shot, but don’t go blabbing about it.\nSherwood: Of course. Thanks, Bill. I appreciate the trust. Talk to you soon.\nSherwood continues to be productive at home and maintains his lower in-office performance. He\nreviews the results with his boss after two weeks and continues with four remote days per week for an\nadditional two weeks until Tuesday, September 19, when he requests a full-time remote trial of two\nweeks while he is visiting relatives out of state. 67 Sherwood’s team is in the middle of a project that\nrequires his expertise, and he is prepared to quit if his boss refuses. He realizes that, just as you want to\nnegotiate ad pricing close to deadlines, getting what you want often depends more on when you ask for it\nthan how you ask for it. Though he would prefer not to quit, his income from shirts is more than enough\nto fund his dream-lines of Oktoberfest and beyond.\nHis boss acquiesces and Sherwood doesn’t have to use his threat of quitting. He goes home that\nevening and buys a $524 round-trip ticket, less than one week’s shirt sales, to Munich for Oktoberfest.\nNow he can implement all the time-savers possible and hack out the inessentials. Somewhere between\ndrinking wheat beer and dancing in lederhosen, Sherwood will get his work done in fine form, leaving\nhis company better off than prior to 80/20 and leaving himself all the time in the world.\nBut hold on a second … What if your boss still refuses? Hmm … Then they force your hand. If upper\nmanagement won’t see the light, you’ll just have to use the next chapter to fire their asses.\nAn Alternative: The Hourglass Approach\nIt can be effective to take a longer period of absence up front in what some NR have termed the\n“hourglass” approach, so named because you use a long proof-of-concept up front to get a short remote\nagreement and then negotiate back up to full-time out of the office. Here’s what it looks like.\n1. Use a preplanned project or emergency (family issue, personal issue, relocation, home repairs,\nwhatever) that requires you to take one or two weeks out of the office.\n2. Say that you recognize you can’t just stop working and that you would prefer to work instead of\ntaking vacation days.\n3. Propose how you can work remotely and offer, if necessary, to take a pay cut for that period (and\nthat period only) if performance isn’t up to par upon returning.\n4. Allow the boss to collaborate on how to do it so that he or she is invested in the process.\n5. Make the two weeks “off” the most productive period you’ve ever had at work.\n6. Show your boss the quantifiable results upon returning, and tell him or her that—without all the\ndistractions, commute, etc.—you can get twice as much done. Suggest two or three days at home\nper week as a trial for two weeks.\n7. Make those remote days ultraproductive.\n8. Suggest only one or two days in the office per week.\n9. Make those days the least productive of the week.\n10. Suggest complete mobility—the boss will go for it.\nQ&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS\nRecently, I was asked if I was going to fire an employee who made a mistake that cost the\ncompany $600,000. No, I replied, I just spent $600,000 training him.\n—THOMAS J. WATSON, founder of IBM\nLiberty means responsibility. That is why most men dread it.\n—GEORGE BERNARD SHAW\nWhile entrepreneurs have the most trouble with Automation, since they fear giving up control,\nemployees get stuck on Liberation because they fear taking control. Resolve to grab the reins—the rest\nof your life depends on it.\nThe following questions and actions will help you to replace presence-based work with performancebased\nfreedom.\n1. If you had a heart attack, and assuming your boss were sympathetic, how could you work\nremotely for four weeks?\nIf you hit a brick wall with a task that doesn’t seem remote-compatible or if you predict resistance\nfrom your boss, ask the following:\nWhat are you accomplishing with this task—what is the\npurpose?\nIf you had to find other ways to accomplish the same—if your\nlife depended on it—how would you do it? Remote\nconferencing? Video conferencing? GoToMeeting,\nGoToMyPC, DimDim.com (Mac), or related services?\nWhy would your boss resist remote work? What is the\nimmediate negative effect it would have on the company and\nwhat could you do to prevent or minimize it?\n2. Put yourself in your boss’s shoes. Based on your work history, would you trust yourself to\nwork outside of the office?\nIf you wouldn’t, reread Elimination to improve production and consider the hourglass option.\n3. Practice environment-free productivity.\nAttempt to work for two to three hours in a café for two Saturdays prior to proposing a remote\ntrial. If you exercise in a gym, attempt to exercise for those two weeks at home or otherwise\noutside of the gym environment. The purpose here is to separate your activities from a single\nenvironment and ensure that you have the discipline to work solo.\n4. Quantify current productivity.\nIf you have applied the 80/20 Principle, set the rules of interrupting interruption, and completed\nrelated groundwork, your performance should be at an all-time high in quantifiable terms, whether\ncustomers served, revenue generated, pages produced, speed of accounts receivable, or otherwise.\nDocument this.\n5. Create an opportunity to demonstrate remote work productivity before asking for it as a\npolicy.\nThis is to test your ability to work outside of an office environment and rack up some proof that\nyou can kick ass without constant supervision.\n6. Practice the art of getting past “no” before proposing.\nGo to farmers’ markets to negotiate prices, ask for free first-class upgrades, ask for compensation\nif you encounter poor service in restaurants, and otherwise ask for the world and practice using the\nfollowing magic questions when people refuse to give it to you.\n“What would I need to do to [desired outcome]?”\n“Under what circumstances would you [desired outcome]?”\n“Have you ever made an exception?”\n“I’m sure you’ve made an exception before, haven’t you?”\n(If no for either of the last two, ask, “Why not?” If yes, ask, “Why?”)\n7. Put your employer on remote training wheels—propose Monday or Friday at home.\nConsider doing this, or the following step, during a period when it would be too disruptive to fire\nyou, even if you were marginally less productive while remote.\nIf your employer refuses, it’s time to get a new boss or become an entrepreneur. The job will\nnever give you the requisite time freedom. If you decide to jump ship, consider letting them make\nyou walk the plank—quitting is often less appealing than tactfully getting fired and using\nseverance or unemployment to take a long vacation.\n8. Extend each successful trial period until you reach full-time or your desired level of mobility.\nDon’t underestimate how much your company needs you. Perform well and ask for what you want.\nIf you don’t get it over time, leave. It’s too big a world to spend most of life in a cubicle.\nLIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION\nConsider trying Earth Class Mail, a service that you can reroute all your mail to, at which point they\nscan and e-mail you everything that comes in, giving you the option of recycling/shredding junk, getting\na scan of the contents, or having specific items forwarded to you or someone you designate. I have not\npersonally used it yet (will be testing it out this month in preparation for an upcoming trip in May), but a\nfriend and author in Portland swears by them and knows the CEO. Seems they’ve gotten good press and\nthe idea seems far better than relying on friends/family who, if they’re anything like my friends/family …\nwill surely drop the ball at some point:-).\n—NATHALIE\nI also use GreenByPhone.com to process checks electronically that come in through my Earth Class\nMail account—they charge $5 a check, but I live in San Diego, my Earth Class Mail office address is in\nSeattle, and I bank in Ohio. It works great!\n—ANDREW\nTo add to your excellent list (we’ve traveled just like that for several years SWEET!), I’d like to add\nmy modifications as a female traveler and a new mom (16-month-old baby). Personal favorites: (1)\nAthleta carries excellent, light, quick-dry clothing that hold up well to sports but still look very\nfashionable. Skorts are a must for looking feminine but being fully covered for hiking and steep pyramid\nsteps—you know what I mean, ladies! Just a note, a slightly longer length will serve you well in a lot of\ncountries, as well as tankini tops and swim skirts for swimming. (2) Fresh & Go toothbrush is simple to\nuse. (3) Marsona sound machine for drowning out unfamiliar noises is a must (regularly use with baby at\nhome too so when they hear the sound they know it’s sleep time!). This has been a lifesaver for us on\nmany trips, and we now use it regularly at home for better sleep. No more changing hotels midtrip to\navoid noise. AND, I know we have to travel light, but with baby a lot of things are nonnegotiable. These\nmake for smoother sailing: (1) Peanut shell sling in black fleece—it’s more comfy than the cotton and\nyou can pop baby in and out wherever you are, from birth to 35 lbs. I never take mine off, it’s part of my\noutfit; (2) Peapod plus portable tent—this is baby’s main bed at home and travel so baby has the same\nsleep place everywhere we go, and the flaps give all travel parties privacy—great from small babies to\nfive-year-olds. I can still jam this onto a little wheeled carry-on and pack mine and baby’s minimal\nclothing around it; (3) Go Go Kidz TravelMate (great for wheeling car seat up to the gate for gate check\nor use on plane); (4) Britax Diplomat car seat is small but kids can use it from birth to approx. four years\nold.\nMake sure the wheeled carry-on bag you get is one size smaller than the allowed carry-on size so you\ndon’t get bumped to check the bag in if the plane is full. You can always nicely argue/reason/bat your\neyelashes that you will put the bag in your foot space. Also, very helpful to give baby something to sip\nor munch on during take off and landing so yours isn’t the baby screaming from ear pain. Happy travels!\n—KARYL\nPRE-EMPTING THE BOSS: COMMON CONCERNS ABOUT REMOTE WORK\nIn the linked article, Cisco acknowledges that remote work arrangements are “here to stay” yet lists a\nset of security issues. It makes sense to preemptively research solutions so that you are armed and ready\nif your employer raises these concerns. http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2008/prod_020508.html.\n—Contributed by RAINA\n58. If you’re an entrepreneur, don’t skip this chapter. This introduction to remote working tools and\ntactics is integral to the international pieces of the puzzle that follow.\n59. This verb is used by Japanese women as well, even though female workers are referred to as\n“OL”—office ladies.\n60. Any reason to be home will do (cable or phone installation, home repairs, etc.) or, if you prefer\nnot to use a ruse, work a weekend or take two vacation days.\n61. Review the Puppy Dog Close from “Income Autopilot II: Testing the Muse.”\n62. Do not digress from your goal. Once you’ve addressed an objection or concern, go for the close.\n63. Friday is the best day to be in the office. People are relaxed and tend to leave early.\n64. Do not accept a vague refusal. Pinpointing the main concern in detail enables you to overcome it.\n65. Don’t jump to the defensive after an objection. Acknowledge the validity of a boss’s concerns to\nprevent an ego-driven battle of wills.\n66. Note this indirect threat dressed as a confession. It will make the boss think twice about refusing\nbut prevents the win-lose outcome of an ultimatum.\n67. This removes the boss’s ability to call you to the office. This is critical for making the first jump\noverseas.\nBeyond Repair\nKILLING YOUR JOB\nAll courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it’s impossible), but\ncalculating risk and acting decisively. Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth.\nDevelop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer.\n—NICCOLÒ MACHIAVELLI, The Prince\nExistential Pleas and Resignations Mad Libs\nBY ED MURRAY\n\nSome jobs are simply beyond repair.\nImprovements would be like adding a set of designer curtains to a jail cell: better but far from good. In\nthe context of this chapter, “job” will refer to both a company if you run one and a normal job if you\nhave one. Some recommendations are limited to one of the two but most are relevant to both. So we\nbegin.\nI have quit three jobs and been fired from most of the rest. Getting fired, despite sometimes coming as\na surprise and leaving you scrambling to recover, is often a godsend: Someone else makes the decision\nfor you, and it’s impossible to sit in the wrong job for the rest of your life. Most people aren’t lucky\nenough to get fired and die a slow spiritual death over 30–40 years of tolerating the mediocre.\nPride and Punishment\nIf you must play, decide on three things at the start: the rules of the game, the stakes, and the\nquitting time.\n—CHINESE PROVERB\nJust because something has been a lot of work or consumed a lot of time doesn’t make it productive or\nworthwhile.\nJust because you are embarrassed to admit that you’re still living the consequences of bad decisions\nmade 5, 10, or 20 years ago shouldn’t stop you from making good decisions now. If you let pride stop\nyou, you will hate life 5, 10, and 20 years from now for the same reasons. I hate to be wrong and sat in a\ndead-end trajectory with my own company until I was forced to change directions or face total\nbreakdown—I know how hard it is.\nNow that we’re all on a level playing field: Pride is stupid.\nBeing able to quit things that don’t work is integral to being a winner. Going into a project or job\nwithout defining when worthwhile becomes wasteful is like going into a casino without a cap on what\nyou will gamble: dangerous and foolish.\n“But, you don’t understand my situation. It’s complicated!” But is it really? Don’t confuse the\ncomplex with the difficult. Most situations are simple—many are just emotionally difficult to act upon.\nThe problem and the solution are usually obvious and simple. It’s not that you don’t know what to do. Of\ncourse you do. You are just terrified that you might end up worse off than you are now.\nI’ll tell you right now: If you’re at this point, you won’t be worse off. Revisit fear-setting and cut the\ncord.\nLike Pulling Off a Band-Aid: It’s Easier and Less Painful Than\nYou Think\nThe average man is a conformist, accepting miseries and disasters with the stoicism of a cow\nstanding in the rain.\n—COLIN WILSON, British author of The Outsider; New Existentialist\nThere are several principal phobias that keep people on sinking ships, and there are simple rebuttals\nfor all of them.\n1. Quitting is permanent.\nFar from it. Use the Q&A questions in this chapter and chapter 3 (Fear-setting) to examine how you\ncould pick up your chosen career track or start another company at a later point. I have never seen an\nexample where a change of direction wasn’t somehow reversible.\n2. I won’t be able to pay the bills.\nSure you will. First of all, the objective will be to have a new job or source of cash flow before quitting\nyour current job. Problem solved.\nIf you jump ship or get fired, it isn’t hard to eliminate most expenses temporarily and live on savings\nfor a brief period. From renting out your home to refinancing or selling it, there are options. There are\nalways options.\nIt might be emotionally difficult, but you won’t starve. Park your car in the garage and cancel\ninsurance for a few months. Carpool or take the bus until you find the next gig. Rack up some more\ncredit card debt and cook instead of eating out. Sell all the crap that you spent hundreds or thousands on\nand never use.\nTake a full inventory of your assets, cash reserves, debts, and monthly expenses. How long could you\nsurvive with your current resources or if you sold some assets?\nGo through all expenses and ask yourself, If I had to eliminate this because I needed an extra kidney,\nhow would I do it? Don’t be melodramatic when there is no need—few things are fatal, particularly for\nsmart people. If you’ve made it this far in life, losing or dropping a job will often be little more than a\nfew weeks of vacation (unless you want more) prior to something better.\n3. Health insurance and retirement accounts disappear if I quit.\nUntrue.\nI was scared of both when I was eliminated from TrueSAN. I had visions of rotting teeth and working\nat Wal-Mart to survive.\nUpon looking at the facts and exploring options, I realized that I could have identical medical and\ndental coverage—the same provider and network—for $300–500 per month. To transfer my 401(k) to\nanother company (I chose Fidelity Investments) was even easier: It took less than 30 minutes via phone\nand cost nothing.\nCovering both of these bases takes less time than getting a customer service rep on the phone to fix\nyour electric bill.\n4. It will ruin my resume.\nI love creative nonfiction.\nIt is not at all difficult to sweep gaps under the rug and make uncommon items the very things that get\njob interviews. How? Do something interesting and make them jealous. If you quit and then sit on your\nass, I wouldn’t hire you either.\nOn the other hand, if you have a one-to-two-year world circumnavigation on your resume or training\nwith professional soccer teams in Europe to your credit, two interesting things happen upon returning to\nthe working world. First, you will get more interviews because you will stand out. Second, interviewers\nbored in their own jobs will spend the entire meeting asking how you did it!\nIf there is any question of why you took a break or left your previous job, there is one answer that\ncannot be countered: “I had a once-in-a-lifetime chance to do [exotic and envy-producing experience]\nand couldn’t turn it down. I figured that, with [20–40] years of work to go, what’s the rush?”\nThe Cheesecake Factor\nWould you like me to give you a formula for success? It’s quite simple, really. Double your rate of\nfailure.\n—THOMAS J. WATSON, founder of IBM\nSUMMER 1999\nEven before I tasted it, I knew something wasn’t quite right. After eight hours in the refrigerator, this\ncheesecake still hadn’t set at all. It swished in the gallon bowl like a viscous soup, chunks shifting and\nbobbing as I tilted it under close inspection. Somewhere a mistake had been made. It could have been\nany number of things:\nThree 1 lb. sticks of Philly Cream Cheese\nEggs\nStevia\nUnflavored gelatin\nVanilla\nSour cream\nIn this case, it was probably a combination of things and the lack of a few simple ingredients that\ngenerally make cheesecake a form of cake.\nI was on a no-carbohydrate diet, and I had used this recipe before. It had been so delicious that my\nroommates wanted their fair share and insisted on an attempt at bulk production. Hence began the\nmathematical shenanigans and problems.\nBefore Splenda® and other miracles of sugar imitation came on the scene, the hard core used stevia,\nan herb 300 times sweeter than sugar. One drop was like 300 packets of sugar. It was a delicate tool and I\nwasn’t a delicate cook. I had once made a small handful of cookies using baking soda instead of baking\npowder, and that was bad enough to drive my roommates to puke on the lawn. This new masterpiece\nmade the cookies look like fine dining: It tasted like liquid cream cheese mixed with cold water and\nabout 600 packets of sugar.\nI then did what any normal and rational person would do: I grabbed the largest soup ladle with a sigh\nand sat down in front of the TV to face my punishment. I had wasted an entire Sunday and a boatload of\ningredients—it was time to reap what I had sown.\nOne hour and 20 large spoonfuls later, I hadn’t made a dent in the enormous batch of soup, but I was\ndown for the count. Not only could I not eat anything but soup for two days, I couldn’t bring myself to\neven look at cheesecake, previously my favorite dessert, for more than four years.\nStupid? Of course. It’s about as stupid as one can get. This is a ridiculous and micro example of what\npeople do on a larger scale with jobs all the time: self-imposed suffering that can be avoided. Sure, I\nlearned a lesson and paid for the mistake. The real question is—for what?\nThere are two types of mistakes: mistakes of ambition and mistakes of sloth.\nThe first is the result of a decision to act—to do something. This type of mistake is made with\nincomplete information, as it’s impossible to have all the facts beforehand. This is to be encouraged.\nFortune favors the bold.\nThe second is the result of a decision of sloth—to not do something—wherein we refuse to change a\nbad situation out of fear despite having all the facts. This is how learning experiences become terminal\npunishments, bad relationships become bad marriages, and poor job choices become lifelong prison\nsentences.\n“Yeah, but what if I’m in an industry where jumping around is looked down upon? I’ve been here\nbarely a year, and prospective employers would think…”\nWould they? Test assumptions before condemning yourself to more misery. I’ve seen one determinant\nof sex appeal to good employers: performance. If you are a rock star when it comes to results, it doesn’t\nmatter if you jump ship from a bad company after three weeks. On the other hand, if tolerating a\npunishing work environment for years at a time is a prerequisite for promotion in your field, could it be\nthat you’re in a game not worth winning?\nThe consequences of bad decisions do not get better with age.\nWhat cheesecake are you eating?\nQ&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS\nOnly those who are asleep make no mistakes.\n—INGVAR KAMPRAD, founder of IKEA, world’s largest furniture brand\nTens of thousands of people, most of them less capable than you, leave their jobs every day. It’s\nneither uncommon nor fatal. Here are a few exercises to help you realize just how natural job changes\nare and how simple the transition can be.\n1. First, a familiar reality check: Are you more likely to find what you want in your current job or\nsomewhere else?\n2. If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control?\n3. Take a sick day and post your resume on the major job sites. Even if you have no immediate plans\nto leave your job, post your resume on sites such as www.monster.com and www.careerbuilder.com,\nusing a pseudonym if you prefer. This will show you that there are options besides\nyour current place of work. Call headhunters if your level makes such a step appropriate, and send\na brief e-mail such as the one below to friends and non-work contacts.\nDear All,\nI am considering making a career move and am interested in all opportunities that might come to\nmind. Nothing is too outrageous or out of left field. [If you know what you want or don’t want on\nsome level, feel free to add, “I am particularly interested in …” or “I would like to avoid …”]\nPlease let me know if anything comes to mind!\nTim\nCall in sick or take a vacation day to complete all of these exercises during a normal 9–5 workday.\nThis will simulate unemployment and lessen the fear factor of non-office limbo.\nIn the world of action and negotiation, there is one principle that governs all others: The person\nwho has more options has more power. Don’t wait until you need options to search for them. Take\na sneak peek at the future now and it will make both action and being assertive easier.\n4. If you run or own a company, imagine that you have just been sued and must declare bankruptcy.\nThe company is now insolvent and you must close up shop.

This\nchapter is your final exam in muse design.\nThe transformation begins in a small Mexican village, in a parable that’s been shared in various forms\naround the world.\nFables and Fortune Hunters\nAn American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal Mexican village on doctor’s orders.\nUnable to sleep after an urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to the pier to\nclear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked, and inside the boat were several large\nyellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.\n“How long did it take you to catch them?” the American asked.\n“Only a little while,” the Mexican replied in surprisingly good English.\n“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?” the American then asked.\n“I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,” the Mexican said as he unloaded them\ninto a basket.\n“But … What do you do with the rest of your time?”\nThe Mexican looked up and smiled. “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with\nmy wife, Julia, and stroll into the village each evening, where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos.\nI have a full and busy life, señor.”\nThe American laughed and stood tall. “Sir, I’m a Harvard M.B.A. and can help you. You should spend\nmore time fishing, and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. In no time, you could buy several boats with\nthe increased haul. Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats.”\nHe continued, “Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the consumers,\neventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You\nwould need to leave this small coastal fishing village, of course, and move to Mexico City, then to Los\nAngeles, and eventually New York City, where you could run your expanding enterprise with proper\nmanagement.”\nThe Mexican fisherman asked, “But, señor, how long will all this take?”\nTo which the American replied, “15–20 years. 25 tops.”\n“But what then, señor?”\nThe American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right, you would announce an\nIPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions.”\n“Millions, señor? Then what?”\n“Then you would retire and move to a small coastal fishing village, where you would sleep late, fish a\nlittle, play with your kids, take a siesta with your wife, and stroll to the village in the evenings where you\ncould sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos …”\nI RECENTLY HAD lunch in San Francisco with a good friend and former college roommate. He will soon\ngraduate from a top business school and return to investment banking. He hates coming home from the\noffice at midnight but explained to me that, if he works 80-hour weeks for nine years, he could become a\nmanaging director and make a cool $3–10 million per year. Then he would be successful.\n“Dude, what on earth would you do with $3–10 million per year?” I asked.\nHis answer? “I would take a long trip to Thailand.”\nThat just about sums up one of the biggest self-deceptions of our modern age: extended world travel\nas the domain of the ultrarich. I’ve also heard the following:\n“I’ll just work in the firm for 15 years. Then I’ll be partner and I can cut back on hours. Once I have a\nmillion or two in the bank, I’ll put it in something safe like bonds, take $80,000 a year in interest, and\nretire to sail in the Caribbean.”\n“I’ll only work in consulting until I’m 35, then retire and ride a motorcycle across China.”\nIf your dream, the pot of gold at the end of the career rainbow, is to live large in Thailand, sail around\nthe Caribbean, or ride a motorcycle across China, guess what? All of them can be done for less than\n$3,000. I’ve done all three. Here are just two examples of how far a little can go. 68\n$250 U.S. Five days on a private Smithsonian tropical research island with three local fishermen who\ncaught and cooked all my food and also took me on tours of the best hidden dive spots in Panamá.\n$150 U.S. Three days of chartering a private plane in Mendoza wine country in Argentina and flying\nover the most beautiful vineyards around the snowcapped Andes with a personal guide.\nQuestion: What did you spend your last $400 on? It’s two or three weekends of nonsense and\nthrowaway forget-the-workweek behavior in most U.S. cities. $400 is nothing for a full eight days of\nlife-changing experiences. But eight days isn’t what I’m recommending at all. Those were just interludes\nin a much larger production. I’m proposing much, much more.\nThe Birth of Mini-Retirements and\nthe Death of Vacations\nThere is more to life than increasing its speed.\n—MOHANDAS GANDHI\nIn February of 2004, I was miserable and overworked.\nMy travel fantasy began as a plan to visit Costa Rica in March 2004 for four weeks of Spanish and\nrelaxation. I needed a recharge and four weeks seemed “reasonable” by whatever made-up benchmark\nyou can use for such a thing.\nA friend familiar with Central America dutifully pointed out that it would never work, as Costa Rica\nwas about to enter its rainy season. Torrential downpours weren’t the uplifting jolt I needed, so I shifted\nmy focus to four weeks in Spain. It’s a long trip over the Atlantic, though, and Spain was close to other\ncountries I’d always wanted to visit. I lost “reasonable” somewhere shortly thereafter and decided that I\ndeserved a full three months to explore my roots in Scandinavia after four weeks in Spain.\nIf there were any real-time bombs or pending disasters, they would certainly crop up in the first four\nweeks, so there really wasn’t any additional risk in extending my trip to three months. Three months\nwould be great.\nThose three months turned into 15, and I started to ask myself, “Why not take the usual 20–30-year\nretirement and redistribute it throughout life instead of saving it all for the end?”\nThe Alternative to Binge Traveling\nThanks to the Interstate Highway System, it is now possible to travel from coast to coast\nwithout seeing anything.\n—CHARLES KURALT, CBS news reporter\nIf you are accustomed to working 50 weeks per year, the tendency, even after creating the mobility to\ntake extended trips, will be to go nuts and see 10 countries in 14 days and end up a wreck. It’s like taking\na starving dog to an all-you-can-eat buffet. It will eat itself to death.\nI did this three months into my 15-month vision quest, visiting seven countries and going through at\nleast 20 check-ins and checkouts with a friend who had negotiated three weeks off. The trip was an\nadrenaline-packed blast but like watching life on fast-forward. It was hard for us to remember what had\nhappened in which countries (except Amsterdam), 69 we were both sick most of the time, and we were\nupset to have to leave some places simply because our pre-purchased flights made it so.\nI recommend doing the exact opposite.\nThe alternative to binge travel—the mini-retirement—entails relocating to one place for one to six\nmonths before going home or moving to another locale. It is the anti-vacation in the most positive sense.\nThough it can be relaxing, the mini-retirement is not an escape from your life but a reexamination of it—\nthe creation of a blank slate. Following elimination and automation, what would you be escaping from?\nRather than seeking to see the world through photo ops between foreign-but-familiar hotels, we aim to\nexperience it at a speed that lets it change us.\nThis is also different from a sabbatical. Sabbaticals are often viewed much like retirement: as a onetime\nevent. Savor it now while you can. The mini-retirement is defined as recurring—it is a lifestyle. I\ncurrently take three or four mini-retirements per year and know dozens who do the same. Sometimes\nthese sojourns take me around the world; oftentimes they take me around the corner—Yosemite, Tahoe,\nCarmel—but to a different world psychologically, where meetings, e-mail, and phone calls don’t exist\nfor a set period of time.\nPurging the Demons: Emotional Freedom\nThis is the very perfection of a man, to find out his own im perfection.\n—SAINT AUGUSTINE (354 A.D.–430 A.D.)\nTrue freedom is much more than having enough income and time to do what you want. It is quite\npossible—actually the rule rather than the exception—to have financial and time freedom but still be\ncaught in the throes of the rat race. One cannot be free from the stresses of a speed- and size-obsessed\nculture until you are free from the materialistic addictions, time-famine mind-set, and comparative\nimpulses that created it in the first place.\nThis takes time. The effect is not cumulative, and no number of two-week (also called “too weak”) 70\nsightseeing trips can replace one good walkabout. 71\nIn the experience of those I’ve interviewed, it takes two to three months just to unplug from obsolete\nroutines and become aware of just how much we distract ourselves with constant motion. Can you have\na two-hour dinner with Spanish friends without getting anxious? Can you get accustomed to a small town\nwhere all businesses take a siesta for two hours in the afternoon and then close at 4:00 P.M.? If not, you\nneed to ask, Why?\nLearn to slow down. Get lost intentionally. Observe how you judge both yourself and those around\nyou. Chances are that it’s been a while. Take at least two months to disincorporate old habits and\nrediscover yourself without the reminder of a looming return flight.\nThe Financial Realities: It Just Gets Better\nThe economic argument for mini-retirements is the icing on the cake. Four days in a decent hotel or a\nweek for two at a nice hostel costs the same as a month in a nice posh apartment. If you relocate, the\nexpenses abroad also begin to replace—often at much lower cost—bills you can then cancel stateside.\nHere are some actual monthly figures from recent travels.\nHighlights from both South America and Europe are shown side by side to prove that luxury is limited\nby your creativity and familiarity with the locale, not gross currency devaluation in third-world countries.\nIt will be obvious that I did not survive on bread and begging—I lived like a rock star—and both\nexperiences could be done for less than 50% of what I spent. My goal was enjoyment and not austere\nsurvival.\nAirfare\nFree, courtesy of AMEX gold card and Chase Continental Airlines\nMastercard 72\nHousing\nPenthouse apartment on the equivalent of New York’s Fifth\nAvenue in Buenos Aires, including house cleaners, personal\nsecurity guards, phone, energy, and high-speed Internet: $550\nU.S. per month\nEnormous apartment in the trendy SoHo-like Prenzlauerberg\ndistrict of Berlin, including phone and energy: $300 U.S. per\nmonth\nMeals\nFour- or five-star restaurant meals twice daily in Buenos Aires:\n$10 U.S. ($300 U.S. per month)\nBerlin: $18 U.S. ($540 U.S. per month)\nEntertainment\nVIP table and unlimited champagne for eight people at the hottest\nclub, Opera Bay, in Buenos Aires: $150 U.S. ($18.75 U.S. per\nperson x four visits per month = $75 U.S. per month per person)\nCover, drinks, and dancing at the hottest clubs in West Berlin: $20\nU.S. per person per night x 4 = $80 U.S. per month\nEducation\nTwo hours daily of private Spanish lessons in Buenos Aires, fives\ntimes per week: $5 U.S. per hour x 40 hours per month = $200\nU.S. per month\nTwo hours daily of private tango lessons with two world-class\nprofessional dancers: $8.33 U.S. per hour x 40 hours per month =\n$333.20 U.S. per month\nFour hours daily of top-tier German-language instruction in\nNollendorfplatz, Berlin: $175 U.S. per month, which would have\npaid for itself even if I had not attended classes, as the student ID\ncard entitled me to over 40% discounts on all transportation\nSix hours per week of mixed martial arts (MMA) training at the\ntop Berlin academy: free in exchange for tutoring in English two\nhours per week\nTransportation\nMonthly subway pass and daily cab rides to and from tango\nlessons in Buenos Aires: $75 U.S. per month\nMonthly subway, tram, and bus pass in Berlin with student\ndiscount: $85 U.S. per month\nFour-Week Total for Luxury Living\nBuenos Aires: $1533.20 , including round-trip airfare from JFK,\nwith a one-month stopover in Panamá.

There’s no looking at a building here after seeing Italy.\n—FANNY BURNEY (1752–1840), English novelist\nBut I have a house and kids. I can’t travel!\nWhat about health insurance? What if something happens?\nIsn’t travel dangerous? What if I get kidnapped or mugged?\nBut I’m a woman—traveling alone would be dangerous.\nMost excuses not to travel are exactly that—excuses. I’ve been there, so this isn’t a holier-than-thou\nsermon. I know too well that it’s easier to live with ourselves if we cite an external reason for inaction.\nI’ve since met paraplegics and the deaf, senior citizens and single mothers, home owners and the poor,\nall of whom have sought and found excellent life-changing reasons for extended travel instead of\ndwelling on the million small reasons against it.\nMost of the concerns above are addressed in the Q&A, but one in particular requires a bit of\npreemptive nerve calming.\nIt’s 10:00 P.M. Do You Know Where Your Children Are?\nThe prime fear of all parents prior to their first international trip is somehow losing a child in the shuffle.\nThe good news is that if you are comfortable taking your kids to New York, San Francisco,\nWashington, D.C., or London, you will have even less to worry about in the starting cities I recommend\nin the Q&A. There are fewer guns and violent crimes in all of them compared to most large U.S. cities.\nThe likelihood of problems is decreased further when travel is less airport and hotel-hopping among\nstrangers and more relocation to a second home: a mini-retirement.\nBut still, what if?\nJen Errico, a single mother who took her two children on a five-month world tour, had a more acute\nfear than most, one that often woke her at 2:00 A.M. in a cold sweat: What if something happens to me?\nShe wanted to prime her kids for worst-case scenario but didn’t want to scare them to death, so—like\nall good mothers—she made it a game: Who can best memorize the itineraries, hotel addresses, and\nMom’s phone number? She had emergency contacts in each country whose numbers were loaded into\nthe speed dial of her cell phone, which had global roaming. In the end, nothing happened. Now she’s\nplanning to move to a ski chalet in Europe and send her kids to school in multilingual France. Success\nbegets success.\nShe was most afraid in Singapore, and in retrospect, it was where she had the least reason to be\nworried (she took her kids to South Africa, among other places). She was scared because it was the first\nstop and she was unaccustomed to traveling with her kids. It was perception, not reality.\nRobin Malinsky-Rummell, who spent a year traveling through South America with her husband and\nseven-year-old son, was warned by friends and family not to visit Argentina after their devaluation riots\nin 2001. She did her homework, decided that the fear was unfounded, and proceeded to have the time of\nher life in Patagonia. When she told locals that she was originally from New York, their eyes widened\nand jaws dropped: “I saw those buildings blow up on TV! I would never go to such a dangerous place!”\nDon’t assume that places abroad are more dangerous than your hometown. Most aren’t.\nRobin is convinced, as are other NR parents, that people use children as an excuse to stay in their\ncomfort zones. It’s an easy excuse not to do something adventurous. How to overcome the fear? Robin\nrecommends two things:\n1. Before embarking on a long international trip with your children for the first time, take a trial run\nfor a few weeks.\n2. For each stop, arrange a week of language classes that begin upon arrival and take advantage of\ntransportation from the airport if available. The school staff will often handle apartment rentals for\nyou, and you will be able to make friends and learn the area before setting off on your own.\nBut what if your concern isn’t so much losing your children but losing your mind because of your\nchildren?\nSeveral families interviewed for this book recommended the oldest persuasive tool known to man:\nbribery. Each child is given some amount of virtual cash, 25–50 cents, for each hour of good behavior.\nThe same amount is subtracted from their accounts for breaking the rules. All purchases for fun—\nwhether souvenirs, ice cream, or otherwise—come out of their own individual accounts. No balance, no\ngoodies. This often requires more self-control on the part of the parents than the children.\nHow to Get Airfare at 50–80% Off\nThis is not a book on budget travel. Most of the cost-cutting recommendations found in such guides\nare designed with the binge traveler in mind. For someone embarking on a mini-retirement, an extra $150\nfor hassle-free airfare amortized over two months is a better deal than 20 hours of manipulating frequentflier\npoints on an unknown airline or chasing questionable deals.\nFollowing two weeks of research, I once bought a one-way standby ticket to Europe for $120. I\narrived at JFK brimming with enthusiasm and confidence—look at all these schmucks paying retail!—\nand 90% of the “participating” airlines refused my ticket. Those that didn’t were booked for weeks solid.\nI ended up staying in a hotel for two nights for a $300 tab, filing a complaint with AMEX, and\neventually calling 1–800-FLY-EUROPE from the JFK terminal in frustration. I bought a round-trip\nticket to London on Virgin Atlantic for $300 and left an hour later. The same ticket cost more than $700\na week earlier.\nAfter 25 countries, I’ve found a few simple strategies that get you 90% of the possible savings without\nwasting time or producing migraines.\n1. Use credit cards with reward points for large muse-related advertising and manufacturing\nexpenses.\nI am not spending more money to get pennies on the dollar—these costs are inevitable, so I\ncapitalize on them. This alone gets me a free round-trip international ticket each three months.\n2. Purchase tickets far in advance (three months or more) or last minute, and aim for both departure\nand return between Tues day and Thursday.\nLong-term travel planning turns me off and can be expensive if plans change, so I opt for\npurchasing all tickets in the last four or five days prior to target departure. The value of empty\nseats is $0 as soon as the flight takes off, so true last-minute seats are cheap.\nUse Orbitz (www.orbitz.com) and www.kayak.com first. Fix the departure and return dates\nbetween Tuesday and Thursday. Then look at prices for alternative departure dates each of three\ndays into the past and each of three days into the future. Using the cheapest departure date, do the\nsame with the return dates to find the cheapest combination. Check this price against the fares on\nthe website of the airline itself. Then begin bidding on www.priceline.com at 50% of the better of\nthe two, working up in $50 increments until you get a better price or realize it’s not possible.\n3. Consider buying one ticket to an international hub and then an ongoing ticket with a cheap local\nairline.\nIf going to Europe on a tight budget, you could get three tickets. One free Southwest ticket (from\ntransferring AMEX points) from CA to JFK, the cheapest ticket to Heathrow in London, and then\nan übercheap ticket on either Ryanair or EasyJet to a final destination. I have paid as little as $10\nto go from London to Berlin or London to Spain. That is not a typo. Local airlines will often offer\nseats on flights for just the cost of taxes and gasoline. To Central or South American destinations,\nI’ll often look at local flights from Panama or international flights from Miami.\nWhen More Is Less: Cutting the Clutter\nHuman beings have the capacity to learn to want almost any conceivable material object.\nGiven, then, the emergence of a modern industrial culture capable of producing almost\nanything, the time is ripe for opening the storehouse of infinite need! … It is the modern\nPandora’s box, and its plagues are loose upon the world.\n—JULES HENRY\nTo be free, to be happy and fruitful, can only be attained through sacrifice of many common\nbut overestimated things\n—ROBERT HENRI\nI know the son of one deca-millionaire, a personal friend of Bill Gates, who now manages private\ninvestments and ranches. He has accumulated an assortment of beautiful homes over the last decade,\neach with full-time cooks, servants, cleaners, and support staff. How does he feel about having a home\nin each time zone? It’s a pain in the ass! He feels like he’s working for his staff, who spend more time in\nhis homes than he does.\nExtended travel is the perfect excuse to reverse the damage of years of consuming as much as you can\nafford. It’s time to get rid of clutter disguised as necessities before you drag a five-piece Samsonite set\naround the world. That is hell on earth.\nI’m not going to tell you to walk around in a robe and sandals scowling at people who have\ntelevisions. I hate that kashi-crunching holier-than-thou stuff. Turning you into a possession-less scribe\nis not my intention. Let’s face it, though: There are tons of things in your home and life that you don’t\nuse, need, or even particularly want. They just came into your life as impulsive flotsam and jetsam and\nnever found a good exit. Whether you’re aware of it or not, this clutter creates indecision and\ndistractions, consuming attention and making unfettered happiness a real chore. It is impossible to realize\nhow distracting all the crap is—whether porcelain dolls, sports cars, or ragged T-shirts—until you get rid\nof it.\nPrior to my 15-month trip, I was stressed about how to fit all of my belongings into a 14 x 10-foot\nrental storage space. Then I realized a few things: I would never reread the business magazines I’d saved,\nI wore the same five shirts and four pairs of pants 90% of the time, it was about time for new furniture,\nand I never used the outdoor grill or lawn furniture.\nEven getting rid of things I never used proved to be like a capitalist short-circuit. It was hard to toss\nthings I had once thought were valuable enough to spend money on. The first ten minutes of sorting\nthrough clothing was like choosing which child of mine should live or die. I hadn’t exercised my\nthrowing-out muscles in some time. It was a struggle to put nice Christmas clothing I’d never worn into\nthe “go” pile and just as hard to separate myself from worn and ragged clothing I had for sentimental\nreasons. Once I’d passed through the first few tough decisions, though, the momentum had been built and\nit was a breeze. I donated all of the seldom-worn clothing to Goodwill. The furniture took less than 10\nhours to offload using Craigslist, and though I was paid less than 50% of the retail prices for some and\nnothing for others, who cared? I’d used and abused them for five years and would get a new set when I\nlanded back in the U.S. I gave the grill and lawn furniture to my friend, who lit up like a kid at\nChristmas. I had made his month. It felt wonderful and I had an extra $300 in pocket change to cover at\nleast a few weeks of rent abroad.\nI created 40% more space in my apartment and hadn’t even grazed the surface. It wasn’t the extra\nphysical space that I felt most. It was the extra mental space. It was as if I had 20 mental applications\nrunning simultaneously before, and now I had just one or two. My thinking was clearer and I was much,\nmuch happier.\nI asked every vagabond interviewee in this book what their one recommendation would be for firsttime\nextended travelers. The answer was unanimous: Take less with you.\nThe overpacking impulse is hard to resist. The solution is to set what I call a “settling fund.” Rather\nthan pack for all contingencies, I bring the absolute minimum and allocate $100–300 for purchasing\nthings after I arrive and as I travel. I no longer take toiletries or more than a week’s worth of clothing.\nIt’s a blast. Finding shaving cream or a dress shirt overseas can produce an adventure in and of itself.\nPack as if you were coming back in one week. Here are the bare essentials, listed in order of\nimportance:\n1. One week of clothing appropriate to the season, including one semiformal shirt and pair of pants or\nskirt for customs. Think T-shirts, one pair of shorts, and a multipurpose pair of jeans.\n2. Backup photocopies or scanned copies of all important documents: health insurance, passport/visa,\ncredit cards, debit cards, etc.\n3. Debit cards, credit cards, and $200 worth of small bills in local currency (traveler’s checks are not\naccepted in most places and are a hassle)\n4. Small cable bike lock for securing luggage while in transit or in hostels; a small padlock for\nlockers if needed\n5. Electronic dictionaries for target languages (book versions are too slow to be of use in\nconversation) and small grammar guides or texts\n6. One broad-strokes travel guide\nThat’s it. 73 To laptop or not to laptop? Unless you are a writer, I vote no. It’s far too cumbersome and\ndistracting. Using GoToMyPC to access your home computer from Internet cafés encourages the habit\nwe want to develop: making the best use of time instead of killing it.\nThe Bora-Bora Dealmaker\nBAFFIN ISLAND, NUNAVUT\nJosh Steinitz 74 stood at the edge of the world and stared in amazement. He dug his boots into the six\nfeet of sea ice and the unicorns danced.\nTen narwhals—rare cousins of the beluga—came to the surface and pointed their six-foot-plus spiral\ntusks toward the heavens. The pod of 3,000-pound whales then fell into the depths once again. The\nnarwhals are deep divers—more than 3,000 feet in some cases—so Josh had at least 20 minutes until\ntheir reappearance.\nIt seemed appropriate that he was with the narwhals. Their name came from Old Norse and referred to\ntheir mottled white and blue skin.\nNáhvalr—corpse man.\nHe smiled as he had done often in the last few years. Josh himself was a dead man walking.\nOne year after graduating from college, Josh found out that he had oral squamous carcinoma—cancer.\nHe had plans to be a management consultant. He had plans to be lots of things. Suddenly none of it\nmattered. Less than half of those who suffered from this particular type of cancer survived. 75 The reaper\ndidn’t discriminate and came without warning.\nIt became clear that the biggest risk in life wasn’t making mistakes but regret: missing out on things.\nHe could never go back and recapture years spent doing something he disliked.\nTwo years later and cancer-free, Josh set off on an indefinite global walkabout, covering expenses as a\nfreelance writer. He later became the cofounder of a website that provides customized itineraries to\nwould-be vagabonds. His executive status didn’t lessen his mobile addiction. He was as comfortable\ncutting deals from the over-water bungalows of Bora-Bora as he was in the log cabins of the Swiss Alps.\nHe once took a call from a client while at Camp Muir on Mt. Rainier. The client needed to confirm\nsome sales numbers and asked Josh about all the wind in the background. Josh’s answer: “I’m standing\nat 10,000 feet on a glacier and this afternoon the wind is whipping us down the mountain.” The client\nsaid he’d let Josh get back to what he was doing.\nAnother client called Josh while he was leaving a Balinese temple and heard the gongs in the\nbackground. The client asked Josh if he was in church. Josh wasn’t quite sure what to say. All that came\nout was, “Yes?”\nBack among the narwhals, Josh had a few minutes before heading to base camp to avoid polar bears.\nTwenty-four-hour daylight meant that he had much to share with his friends back in the land of cubicles.\nHe sat down on the ice and produced his satellite phone and laptop from a waterproof bag. He began his\ne-mail in the usual way:\n“I know you’re all sick of seeing me have so much fun, but guess where I am?”\nQ&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS\nIt is fatal to know too much at the outcome: boredom comes as quickly to the traveler who\nknows his route as to the novelist who is overcertain of his plot.\n—PAUL THEROUX, To the Ends of the Earth\nIf this is your first time considering a commitment to the mobile lifestyle and long-term adventuring, I\nenvy you! Making the jump and entering the new worlds that await is like upgrading your role in life\nfrom passenger to pilot.\nThe bulk of this Q&A will focus on the precise steps that you should take—and the countdown\ntimeline you can use—when preparing for your first mini-retirement. Most steps can be eliminated or\ncondensed once you get one trip under your belt. Some of the steps are one-time events, after which\nsubsequent mini-retirements will require a maximum of two to three weeks of preparation. It now takes\nme three afternoons.\nGrab a pencil and paper—this will be fun.\n1. Take an asset and cash-flow snapshot.\nSet two sheets of paper on a table. Use one to record all assets and corresponding values, including bank\naccounts, retirement accounts, stocks, bonds, home, and so forth. On the second, draw a line down the\nmiddle and write down all incoming cash flow (salary, muse income, investment income, etc.) and\noutgoing expenses (mortgage, rent, car payments, etc.). What can you eliminate that is either seldom used\nor that creates stress or distraction without adding a lot of value?\n2. Fear-set a one-year mini-retirement in a dream location in Europe.\nUse the questions from chapter 3 to evaluate your worst-case-scenario fears and evaluate the real\npotential consequences. Except in rare cases, most will be avoidable and the rest will be reversible.\n3. Choose a location for your actual mini-retirement. Where to start?\nThis is the big question. There are two options that I advocate:\n1. Choose a starting point and then wander until you find your second home. This is what I did with a\none-way ticket to London, vagabonding throughout Europe until I fell in love with Berlin, where I\nremained for three months.\n2. Scout a region and then settle in your favorite spot. This is what I did with a tour of Central and\nSouth America, where I spent one to four weeks in each of several cities, after which I returned to\nmy favorite—Buenos Aires—for six months.\nIt is possible to take a mini-retirement in your own country, but the transformative effect is hampered if\nyou are surrounded by people who carry the same socially reinforced baggage.\nI recommend choosing an overseas location that will seem foreign but that isn’t dangerous. I box, race\nmotorcycles, and do all sorts of macho things, but I draw the line at favelas, 76 civilians with machine\nguns, pedestrians with machetes, and social strife. Cheap is good, but bullet holes are bad. Check the\nU.S. Department of State for travel warnings before booking tickets (http:// travel.state.gov).\nHere are just a few of my favorite starting points. Feel free to choose other locations. The most\nlifestyle for the dollar is underlined: Argentina (Buenos Aires, Córdoba), China (Shanghai, Hong Kong,\nTaipei), Japan (Tokyo, Osaka), England (London), Ireland (Galway), Thailand (Bangkok, Chiang Mai),\nGermany (Berlin, Munich), Norway (Oslo), Australia (Sydney), New Zealand (Queenstown), Italy\n(Rome, Milan, Florence), Spain (Madrid, Valencia, Sevilla), and Holland (Amsterdam). In all of these\nplaces, it is possible to live well while spending little. I spend less in Tokyo than in California because I\nknow it well. Hip, recently gentrified artist areas, not unlike the Brooklyn of 10 years ago, can be found\nin almost all cities. The one place I can’t seem to find a decent lunch for less than $20 U.S.? London.\nHere are a few exotic places I don’t recommend for vagabonding virgins, though veterans can make\nthem all work: all countries in Africa, the Middle East, or Central and South America (excepting Costa\nRica and Argentina). Mexico City and Mexican border areas are also a bit too kidnap-happy to make it\nonto my favorites list.\n4. Prepare for your trip. Here’s the countdown.\nThree months out—Eliminate\nGet used to minimalism before the departure. Here are the questions to ask and act upon, even if you\nnever plan to leave:\nWhat is the 20% of my belongings that I use 80% of the time? Eliminate the other 80% in clothing,\nmagazines, books, and all else. Be ruthless—you can always repurchase things you can’t live without.\nWhich belongings create stress in my life? This could relate to maintenance costs (money and energy),\ninsurance, monthly expenses, time consumption, or simple distraction. Eliminate, eliminate, eliminate. If\nyou sell even a few expensive items, it could finance a good portion of your mini-retirement. Don’t rule\nout the car and home. It’s always possible to purchase either upon your return, often losing no money in\nthe process.\nCheck current health insurance coverage for extended overseas travel. Get the wheels in motion to\nrent, swap, or sell your home—renting out is most recommended by serial vagabonds—or end your\napartment lease and move all belongings into storage.\nIn all cases where doubts crop up, ask yourself, “If I had a gun to my head and had to do it, how\nwould I do it?” It’s not as hard as you think.\nTwo months out—Automate\nAfter eliminating the excess, contact companies (including suppliers) that bill you regularly and set up\nautopayment with credit cards that have reward points. Telling them that you will be traveling the world\nfor a year often persuades them to accept credit cards rather than chase you around the planet like\nCarmen Sandiego.\nFor the credit card companies themselves and others that refuse, arrange automatic debit from your\nchecking account. Set up online banking and bill payment. Set up all companies that won’t take credit\ncards or automatic debit as online payees. Set these scheduled checks for $15–20 more than expected\nwhen dealing with utilities and other variable expenses. This will cover miscellaneous fees, prevent timeconsuming\nbilling problems, and accrue as a credit. Cancel paper bank and credit card statement\ndelivery. Get bank-issued credit cards for all checking accounts—generally one for business and one for\npersonal—and set the cash advances to $0 to minimize abuse potential. Leave these cards at home, as\nthey are just for emergency overdraft protection.\nGive a trusted member of your family and/or your accountant power of attorney, 77 which gives that\nperson authority to sign documents (tax filings and checks, for example) in your name. Nothing screws\nup foreign fun faster than having to sign original documents when faxes are unacceptable.\nOne month out—\nSpeak to the manager of your local post office and have all mail forwarded to a friend, family member,\nor personal assistant, 78 who will be paid $100–200 per month to e-mail you brief descriptions of all\nnonjunk mail each Monday.\nGet all required and recommended immunizations and vaccinations for your target region. Check the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (www.cdc.gov/travel/). Note that proof of immunizations is\nsometimes required to pass through foreign customs.\nSet up a trial account with GoToMyPC or similar remote-access software and take a dry run to ensure\nthat there are no technological glitches. 79\nIf resellers (or distributors) still send you checks—the fulfillment house should handle customer\nchecks at this point—do one of three things: give the resellers direct bank deposit information (ideal),\nhave the fulfillment house handle these checks (second choice), or have the resellers pay via PayPal or\nmail checks to one of the people you are trusting with power of attorney (far third). In the last case, give\nthe person with power of attorney deposit slips so he or she can sign or stamp and mail in the checks. It\nis convenient to become a member of a large bank (Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Washington Mutual,\nCitibank, etc.) with branches near the person assisting you so that they can drop off the deposits while\nrunning other errands. No need to move all accounts to this bank if you don’t want to; just open a single\nnew account that is used solely for these deposits.\nTwo weeks out—\nScan all identification, health insurance, and credit/debit cards into a computer from which you can print\nmultiple copies, several to be left with family members and several to be taken with you in separate\nbags. E-mail the scanned file to yourself so that you can access it while abroad if you lose the paper\ncopies.\nIf you are an entrepreneur, downgrade your cell phone to the cheapest plan and set up a voicemail\ngreeting that states, “I am currently overseas on business. Please do not leave a voicemail, as I will not\nbe checking it while gone. Please send me an e-mail at __@__.com if the matter is important. Thank you\nfor your understanding.” Then set up e-mail autoresponders that indicate responses could take up to\nseven days (or whatever you decide for frequency) due to international business travel.\nIf you are an employee, consider getting a quad-band or GSM-compatible cell phone so that the boss\ncan contact you. Get a BlackBerry only if your boss will be checking to see if you are working via e-\nmail. Be sure to disable the dead giveaway “Sent from a BlackBerry” signature on outgoing e-mail!\nOther options include using a SkypeIn account that forwards to your foreign cell phone (my preference)\nor a Vonage IP box that allows you to receive landline calls anywhere in the world via a phone number\nthat begins with your home area code.\nFind an apartment for your ultimate mini-retirement destination or reserve a hostel or hotel at your\nstarting point for three to four days. Reserving an apartment before you arrive is riskier and will be much\nmore expensive than using the latter three to four days to find an apartment. I recommend hostels for the\nstarting point if possible—not for cost considerations but because the staff and fellow travelers are more\nknowledgeable and helpful with relocations.\nGet foreign medical evacuation insurance if needed for peace of mind. This tends to be redundant if\nyou are in a first-world country and can buy local insurance to augment your own, which I do, and it is\nuseless if you are a 10-hour flight from civilization. I had evacuation insurance in Panama, as it’s a 2-\nhour flight from Miami, but I didn’t bother elsewhere. Don’t freak out about this; it’s just as true if\nyou’re in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the U.S.\nOne week out—\nDecide on a schedule for routine batched tasks such as e-mail, online banking, etc. to eliminate excuses\nfor senseless pseudo-work procrasterbating. I suggest Monday mornings for checking e-mail and online\nbanking. The first and third Mondays of the month can be used for checking credit cards and making\nother online payments such as affiliates. These promises to yourself will be the hardest to keep, so make\na commitment now and expect serious withdrawal cravings.\nSave important documents—including the scan of your identification, insurance, and credit/debit cards\n—to a small handheld storage device that plugs into a computer USB port.\nMove all things out of your home or apartment into storage, pack a single small backpack and carryon\nbag for the adventure, and move in briefly with a family member or friend.\nTwo days out—\nPut remaining automobiles into storage or a friend’s garage. Put fuel stabilizer like Sta-Bil® in the gas\ntanks, disconnect the negative leads from batteries to prevent drain, and put the vehicles on jack stands to\nprevent tire and shock damage. Cancel all auto insurance except for theft coverage.\nUpon arrival (assuming you have not booked an apartment in advance)—\nFirst morning and afternoon after check-in Take a hop-on-hop-off bus tour of the city followed by a\nbike tour of potential apartment neighborhoods.\nFirst late afternoon or evening Purchase an unlocked 80 cell phone with a SIM card that can be\nrecharged with simple prepaid cards. E-mail apartment owners or brokers on Craigslist.com and online\nversions of local newspapers for viewings over the next two days.\nSecond and third days Find and book an apartment for one month. Don’t commit to more than one\nmonth until you’ve slept there. I once prepaid two months only to find that the busiest bus stop\ndowntown was on the other side of my bedroom wall.\nMove-in day Get settled and purchase local health insurance. Ask hostel owners and other locals what\ninsurance they use. Resolve not to buy souvenirs or other take-home items until two weeks prior to\ndeparture.\nOne week later Eliminate all the extra crap you brought but won’t use often. Either give it to someone\nwho needs it more, mail it back to the U.S., or throw it out.\nTOOLS AND TRICKS\nBrainstorming Mini-Retirement Locations\nVirtual Tourist ( www.virtualtourist.com )\nThe single largest source of unbiased, user-generated travel content in the world.

It is one of Forbes’s Top 13 Travel sites and is “high-falootin’ and low-brow\nall in the same breath” (Frommer’s). Translation: Much of the content is not G-rated.

Originally written by Marc Brosius, it has been added to by newsgroup\nparticipants for years and now covers nuts and bolts from financial planning to return culture shock and\nall in between. How long can you afford to be away? Do you need travel insurance? Leave of absence or\nresignation? This is an around-the-world almanac.\nRemoving Clutter: 1–800-GOT-JUNK ( www.1800gotjunk.com ), Freecycle ( www.freecycle.org\n), and Craigslist ( www.craigslist.org )\nI used Craigslist’s “Free” category to get rid of four years of accumulated possessions in less than three\nhours on a Saturday evening. There were some for-sale items that I also cleared out at 30–40% of\noriginal retail. I then hauled off the last remaining items using the überfast 1–800-GOT-JUNK paid\nservice. Freecycle is comparable to Craigslist for giving away, and getting, things for free when you’re\nshort on time. Get unattached and you’ll make it a habit. I purge every 6–9 months, often including\ndonations to Goodwill (www.goodwill.org), which can do pickups for free with advanced notice.\nOne-Bag: The Art and Science of Packing Light ( www.onebag.com )\nOne of PC magazine’s “Top 100 [Can’t Live Without] Sites.” Pack light and experience lightness of\nbeing.\nU.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (www.cdc.gov/travel)\nRecommended vaccinations and health planning for every nation in the world. Certain countries require\nproof of inoculations to pass through customs. Get the shots well ahead of time, as some take weeks to\norder.\nTax Planning (www.irs.gov/publications/p54/index.html)\nMore good news. Even if you permanently relocate to another country, you will have to pay U.S. taxes as\nlong as you have a U.S. passport! Not to fret—there are some creative legal sidesteps, such as form\n2555-EZ, which can provide up to an $85,700 income exemption if you spend at least 330 days of a\nconsecutive 365 days off U.S. soil. This means you have 35 days in a given 12-month period to spend in\nthe U.S. as you like, but no more. That’s part of the reason my 2004 trip extended to 15 months. Get a\ngood accountant and let them do the detail work to keep yourself out of trouble.\nU.S.-Sponsored Overseas Schools (www.state.gov/m/a/os)\nIf the idea of pulling your children out of school for a year or two isn’t appealing, stick them in one of\nmore than 190 elementary and secondary schools sponsored by the U.S. Department of State in 135\ncountries. Kids love home work.\nHomeschooling 101 and Quickstart Guide (http://bit.ly/homeschooling101)\nThis subsection of http://homeschooling.about.com/provides a step-by-step process for considering\nhomeschooling options that can be applied to education during extended travel. Children can often return\nto traditional public or private schools ahead of their classmates.\nHome Education Magazine (www.homeedmag.com) Rich collection of resources for homeschoolers,\ntraveling families, and unschoolers. Links include curriculum, virtual support groups, legal resources,\nand archives. Good reasons to learn the law: Some U.S. states offer up to $1,600 of funding per year for\nqualified homeschooling expenditures, as it saves the state money to not educate your child in the public\nschool system.\nUniversal Currency Converter ( www.xe.com )\nBefore you get caught up in the excitement and forget that five British pounds does not equal five U.S.\ndollars, use this to translate local costs into numbers you understand. Try not to have too many “Those\ncoins are each worth four dollars?” moments.\nUniversal Plug Adapter ( www.franzus.com )\nCarrying bulky cables and connectors is irritating—get a Travel Smart all-in-one adapter with surge\nprotection. The size of a pack of cards folded in half, it is the only adapter that I’ve used everywhere\nwithout problems. Note that it is an adapter (helps you plug things in), but it is not a transformer.

The site scours a\nvariety of other rental search sites and aggregates the results in one easy-to-use search tool.\nHostels.com ( www.hostels.com )\nThis site isn’t just for youth hostels. I found a nice hotel in downtown Tokyo for $20 per night and have\nused this site for similar housing in eight countries. Think location and reviews (see HotelChatter next)\ninstead of amenities. Four-star hotels are for binge travelers; this site can offer a real local flavor before\nyou find an apartment or other longer-term housing.\nHotelChatter ( www.hotelchatter.com )\nGet the real scoop on this daily web journal with detailed and honest reviews of housing worldwide.\nUpdated several times daily, this site offers the stories of frustrated guests and those who have found\nhidden gems. Online booking is available.\nCraigslist ( www.craigslist.org )\nBesides local weekly magazines with housing listings, such as Bild or Zitty (no joke) in Berlin, I have\nfound Craigslist to be the single best starting point for long-term overseas furnished apartments. As of\nthis writing, there are more than 50 countries represented. That said, prices will be 30–70% less in the\nlocal magazines—if you have a tight budget, get a hostel employee or other local to help you make a few\ncalls and strike a deal. Ask the local helper not to mention you’re a foreigner until pricing is agreed\nupon.\nInterhome International ( www.interhome.com )\nBased in Zurich, more than 20,000 homes for rent in Europe.\nRentvillas.com ( www.rentvillas.com )\nProvides unique renting experiences—from cottages and farmhouses to castles—throughout Europe,\nincluding France, Italy, Greece, Spain, and Portugal.\nComputer Remote Access and Backup Tools\nGoToMyPC ( www.gotomypc.com )\nThis software facilitates quick and easy remote access to your computer’s files, programs, e-mail, and\nnetwork. It can be used from any web browser or wireless device and works in real time. I have used\nGoToMyPC religiously for more than five years to access my U.S.-based computers from countries and\nislands worldwide. This gives me the freedom to leave all computers at home.\nWebExPCNow ( http://pcnow.webex.com )\nWebEx, the leader in corporate remote access, now offers software that does most of what GoToMyPC\noffers, including cut and paste between remote computers, local printing from remote computers, file\ntransfers, and more.\nDropBox (www.getdropbox.com) and SugarSync\n(www.sugarsync.com); then JungleDisk (www.jungledisk.com) and Mozy (www.mozy.com) Both\nDropBox and SugarSync perform backups and synching of files between multiple computers (home and\ntravel computers, for example). JungleDisk and Mozy—I use the latter—have fewer features and are\nmore specifically designed for automatic backups to their online storage.\nFree and Low-Cost Internet (IP) Telephones\nSkype ( www.skype.com )\nSkype is my default for all phone calls. It allows you to call landlines and mobile phones across the globe\nfor an average of 2–5 cents per minute, or connect with other Skype users worldwide for free. For about\n40 euros per year, you can get a U.S. number with your home area code and receive calls that forward to\na foreign cell phone. This makes your travel invisible. Lounge on the beach in Rio and answer calls to\nyour “office” in California. Nice. Skype Chat, which comes with the service, is also perfect for sharing\nsensitive log-in and password information with others, as it’s encrypted.\nVonage (www.vonage.com) and Ooma (www.ooma.com)\nVonage offers a small adapter for a monthly fee that connects your broadband modem to a normal\nphone. Take it on your travels and set it up in your apartment to receive calls to a U.S. number. Ooma\nhas no monthly fees and doesn’t require a landline, but it offers similar hardware you can connect to\nbroadband for a local U.S. number anywhere in the world.\nVoIPBuster (www.voipbuster.com) and RebTel (www.rebtel.com)\nBoth VoIPBuster and RebTel can provide “alias” numbers. Enter a friend’s overseas number on their\nsites, and both will give you a local number in your area code that will forward to your friend.\nVoIPBuster also acts as a cheaper Skype with free calls to more than 20 countries.\nInternational Multi-Band and GSM-Compatible Phones\nMy World Phone ( www.myworldphone.com )\nI’m partial to Nokia phones. Ensure whichever phone you purchase is “unlocked”—that the SIM card\ncan be swapped out in different countries with different providers.\nWorld Electronics USA ( www.worldelectronicsusa.com )\nGood explanation of which GSM frequencies and “bands” function in which countries, which will\ndetermine which phone you purchase for travel (and perhaps home).\nTools for Off-the-Beaten Path\nSatellite Phones ( www.satphonestore.com )\nIf you will be in the mountains of Nepal or on a remote island and want the peace of mind (or headache)\nof having a phone nearby, these phones work via satellite instead of towers. Iridium has been\nrecommended for widest reception (pole to pole), with GlobalStar in second place (three continents).\nRent or purchase.\nPocket-size Solar Panels ( www.solio.com )\nSatellite phones and other small electronics are of little use (skipping stones, perhaps?) if their batteries\ndie. Solio is about the size of two packs of cards and fans out into small solar panels. I was surprised to\nfind that it charged my cell phone in less than 15 minutes—more than twice as fast as a wall outlet.\nAdapters are available for almost anything.\nWhat to Do Once You Get There—Career Experiments and More\nVerge Magazine (see Restricted Reading appendix)\nMeet Up ( www.meetup.com )\nSearch by city and activity to find people who share similar interests all over the world.\nBecome a Travel Writer ( www.writtenroad.com )\nGet paid to travel the world and record your thoughts?

The dollar figures in this chapter are all from a period immediately following President Bush’s\nreelection in 2004, which correlated to the worst dollar exchange rates of the last 20 years.\n69. I refer, of course, to the amazing bike-riding opportunities and famous pastries.\n70. Coined by Joel Stein of the LA Times.\n71. By all means, go ahead and take a post-office celebratory trip and go nuts for a few weeks. I know\nI did. Rock on. Ibiza and glow sticks here I come. Have some absinthe and drink lots of water.\nFollowing that, sit down and plan an introspective mini-retirement.\n72. Muses are low maintenance but often expensive in one or both of two tactical areas:\nmanufacturing and advertising. Shop for providers of both that are willing to accept credit cards as\npayment, and negotiate this up front if necessary by saying, “Rather than trying to negotiate you down\non pricing, I just ask that you accept payment by credit card. If you can do that, we’ll choose you over\nCompetitor X.” This is yet another example of a “firm offer,” and not a question, that puts you in a\nstronger negotiating position.

In this case, it helps\nbecause your accountant can then sign tax documents or checks in your name instead of consuming\nhours and days of your time with faxes, scanners, and expensive international FedEx’ing of\ndocuments.\n78. There are also services like www.earthclassmail.com, which will receive, scan, and e-mail all of\nyour non-junk mail to you as PDFs.\n79. This would be used if you leave your computer at home or in someone else’s home while\ntraveling. This step can be skipped if you bring your computer, but that is like a recovering heroin\naddict bringing a bag of opium to rehab. Don’t tempt yourself to kill time instead of rediscovering it.\n80. “Unlocked” means that it is recharged with prepaid cards instead of being on a monthly payment\nplan with a single carrier such as O2 or Vodafone. This also means that the same phone can be used\nwith carriers in other countries (assuming the frequency is the same) with a simple switch of the SIM\nmemory card for $10–30 U.S. in most cases. Some U.S.-compatible quad-band phones can use SIM\ncards.\nFilling the Void\nADDING LIFE AFTER SUBTRACTING WORK\nTo be engrossed by something outside ourselves is a powerful antidote for the rational mind, the\nmind that so frequently has its head up its own ass.\n—ANNE LAMOTT, Bird by Bird\nThere is not enough time to do all the nothing we want to do.\n—BILL WATTERSON, creator of the Calvin and Hobbes cartoon strip\nKING’S CROSS , LONDON\nI stumbled into the deli across the cobblestone street and ordered a prosciutto sandwich. It was 10:33\nA.M. now, the fifth time I’d checked the time, and the twentieth time I’d asked myself, “What the &%$#\nam I going to do today?”\nThe best answer I had come up with so far was: get a sandwich.\nThirty minutes earlier, I had woken up without an alarm clock for the first time in four years, fresh off\narriving from JFK the night before. I had soooo been looking forward to it: awakening to musical\nbirdsong outside, sitting up in bed with a smile, smelling the aroma of freshly brewed coffee, and\nstretching out overhead like a cat in the shade of a Spanish villa. Magnificent. It turned out more like\nthis: bolt upright as if blasted with a foghorn, grab clock, curse, jump out of bed in underwear to check\ne-mail, remember that I was forbidden to do so, curse again, look for my host and former classmate,\nrealize that he was off to work like the rest of the world, and proceed to have a panic attack.\nI spent the rest of the day in a haze, wandering from museum to botanical garden to museum as if on\nrinse and repeat, avoiding Internet cafés with some vague sense of guilt. I needed a to-do list to feel\nproductive and so put down things like “eat dinner.”\nThis was going to be a lot harder than I had thought.\nPostpartum Depression: It’s Normal\nMan is so made that he can only find relaxation from one kind of labor by taking up another.\n—ANATOLE FRANCE, author of The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard\nI’ve Got More Money and Time Than I Ever Dreamed Possible … Why Am I Depressed?\nIt’s a good question with a good answer. Just be glad you’re figuring this out now and not at the end of\nlife! The retired and ultrarich are often unfulfilled and neurotic for the same reason: too much idle time.\nBut wait a second … Isn’t more time what we’re after? Isn’t that what this book is all about? No, not\nat all. Too much free time is no more than fertilizer for self-doubt and assorted mental tail-chasing.\nSubtracting the bad does not create the good. It leaves a vacuum. Decreasing income-driven work isn’t\nthe end goal. Living more—and becoming more—is.\nIn the beginning, the external fantasies will be enough, and there is nothing wrong with this. I cannot\noveremphasize the importance of this period. Go nuts and live your dreams. This is not superficial or\nselfish. It is critical to stop repressing yourself and get out of the postponement habit.\nLet’s suppose you decide to dip your toe in dreams like relocating to the Caribbean for island-hopping\nor taking a safari in the Serengeti. It will be wonderful and unforgettable, and you should do it. There\nwill come a time, however—be it three weeks or three years later—when you won’t be able to drink\nanother piña colada or photograph another damn red-assed baboon. Self-criticism and existential panic\nattacks start around this time.\nBut This Is What I Always Wanted! How Can I Be Bored?!\nDon’t freak out and fuel the fire. This is normal among all high-performers who downshift after working\nhard for a long time. The smarter and more goal-oriented you are, the tougher these growing pains will\nbe. Learning to replace the perception of time famine with appreciation of time abundance is like going\nfrom triple espressos to decaf.\nBut there’s more! Retirees get depressed for a second reason, and you will too: social isolation.\nOffices are good for some things: free bad coffee and complaining thereof, gossip and commiserating,\nstupid video clips via e-mail with even stupider comments, and meetings that accomplish nothing but kill\na few hours with a few laughs. The job itself might be a dead end, but it’s the web of human interactions\n—the social environment—that keeps us there. Once liberated, this automatic tribal unit disappears,\nwhich makes the voices in your head louder.\nDon’t be afraid of the existential or social challenges. Freedom is like a new sport. In the beginning,\nthe sheer newness of it is exciting enough to keep things interesting at all times. Once you have learned\nthe basics, though, it becomes clear that to be even a half-decent player requires some serious practice.\nDon’t fret. The greatest rewards are to come, and you’re 10 feet from the finish line.\nFrustrations and Doubts: You’re Not Alone\nPeople say that what we are seeking is a meaning for life. I don’t think this is what we’re really\nseeking. I think what we’re seeking is an experience of being alive.\n—JOSEPH CAMPBELL, The Power of Myth\nOnce you eliminate the 9–5 and the rubber hits the road, it’s not all roses and white-sand bliss,\nthough much of it can be. Without the distraction of deadlines and co-workers, the big questions (such as\n“What does it all mean?”) become harder to fend off for a later time. In a sea of infinite options,\ndecisions also become harder—What the hell should I do with my life? It’s like senior year in college all\nover again.\nLike all innovators ahead of the curve, you will have frightening moments of doubt. Once past the kidin-a-candy-store\nphase, the comparative impulse will creep in. The rest of the world will continue with\nits 9–5 grind, and you’ll begin to question your decision to step off the treadmill. Common doubts and\nself-flagellation include the following:\n1. Am I really doing this to be more free and lead a better life, or am I just lazy?\n2. Did I quit the rat race because it’s bad, or just because I couldn’t hack it? Did I just cop out?\n3. Is this as good as it gets? Perhaps I was better off when I was following orders and ignorant of the\npossibilities. It was easier at least.\n4. Am I really successful or just kidding myself?\n5. Have I lowered my standards to make myself a winner? Are my friends, who are now making\ntwice as much as three years ago, really on the right track?\n6. Why am I not happy? I can do anything and I’m still not happy. Do I even deserve it?\nMost of this can be overcome as soon as we recognize it for what it is: outdated comparisons using the\nmore-is-better and money-as-success mind-sets that got us into trouble to begin with. Even so, there is a\nmore profound observation to be made.\nThese doubts invade the mind when nothing else fills it. Think of a time when you felt 100% alive and\nundistracted—in the zone. Chances are that it was when you were completely focused in the moment on\nsomething external: someone or something else. Sports and sex are two great examples. Lacking an\nexternal focus, the mind turns inward on itself and creates problems to solve, even if the problems are\nundefined or unimportant. If you find a focus, an ambitious goal that seems impossible and forces you to\ngrow, 81 these doubts disappear.\nIn the process of searching for a new focus, it is almost inevitable that the “big” questions will creep\nin. There is pressure from pseudo-philosophers everywhere to cast aside the impertinent and answer the\neternal. Two popular examples are “What is the meaning of life?” and “What is the point of it all?”\nThere are many more, ranging from the introspective to the ontological, but I have one answer for\nalmost all of them—I don’t answer them at all.\nI’m no nihilist. In fact, I’ve spent more than a decade investigating the mind and concept of meaning,\na quest that has taken me from the neuroscience laboratories of top universities to the halls of religious\ninstitutions worldwide. The conclusion after it all is surprising.\nI am 100% convinced that most big questions we feel compelled to face—handed down through\ncenturies of overthinking and mistranslation—use terms so undefined as to make attempting to answer\nthem a complete waste of time. 82 This isn’t depressing. It’s liberating.\nConsider the question of questions: What is the meaning of life?\nIf pressed, I have but one response: It is the characteristic state or condition of a living organism. “But\nthat’s just a definition,” the questioner will retort, “that’s not what I mean at all.” What do you mean,\nthen? Until the question is clear—each term in it defined—there is no point in answering it. The\n“meaning” of “life” question is unanswerable without further elaboration.\nBefore spending time on a stress-inducing question, big or otherwise, ensure that the answer is “yes”\nto the following two questions:\n1. Have I decided on a single meaning for each term in this question?\n2. Can an answer to this question be acted upon to improve things?\n“What is the meaning of life?” fails the first and thus the second. Questions about things beyond your\nsphere of influence like “What if the train is late tomorrow?” fail the second and should thus be ignored.\nThese are not worthwhile questions. If you can’t define it or act upon it, forget it. If you take just this\npoint from this book, it will put you in the top 1% of performers in the world and keep most\nphilosophical distress out of your life.\nSharpening your logical and practical mental toolbox is not being an atheist or unspiritual. It’s not\nbeing crass and it’s not being superficial. It’s being smart and putting your effort where it can make the\nbiggest difference for yourself and others.\nThe Point of It All: Drumroll, Please\nWhat man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a\nworthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.\n—VIKTOR E. FRANKL, Holocaust survivor; author of Man’s Search for Meaning\nI believe that life exists to be enjoyed and that the most important thing is to feel good about yourself.\nEach person will have his or her own vehicles for both, and those vehicles will change over time. For\nsome, the answer will be working with orphans, and for others, it will be composing music. I have a\npersonal answer to both—to love, be loved, and never stop learning—but I don’t expect that to be\nuniversal.\nSome criticize a focus on self-love and enjoyment as selfish or hedonistic, but it’s neither. Enjoying\nlife and helping others—or feeling good about yourself and increasing the greater good—are no more\nmutually exclusive than being agnostic and leading a moral life. One does not preclude the other. Let’s\nassume we agree on this. It still leaves the question, “What can I do with my time to enjoy life and feel\ngood about myself?”\nI can’t offer a single answer that will fit all people, but, based on the dozens of fulfilled NR I’ve\ninterviewed, there are two components that are fundamental: continual learning and service.\nLearning Unlimited: Sharpening the Saw\nAmericans who travel abroad for the first time are often shocked to discover that, despite all the\nprogress that has been made in the last 30 years, many foreign people still speak in foreign\nlanguages.\n—DAVE BARRY\nTo live is to learn. I see no other option. This is why I’ve felt compelled to quit or be fired from jobs\nwithin the first six months or so. The learning curve flattens out and I get bored.\nThough you can upgrade your brain domestically, traveling and relocating provides unique conditions\nthat make progress much faster. The different surroundings act as a counterpoint and mirror for your own\nprejudices, making weaknesses that much easier to fix. I rarely travel somewhere without deciding first\nhow I’ll obsess on a specific skill. Here are a few examples:\nConnemara, Ireland: Gaelic Irish, Irish flute, and hurling, the\nfastest field sport in the world (imagine a mix of lacrosse and\nrugby played with axe handles)\nRio de Janeiro, Brazil: Brazilian Portuguese and Brazilian jujitsu\nBerlin, Germany: German and locking (a form of upright breakdancing)\nI tend to focus on language acquisition and one kinesthetic skill, sometimes finding the latter after\nlanding overseas. The most successful serial vagabonds tend to blend the mental and the physical. Notice\nthat I often transport a skill I practice domestically—martial arts—to other countries where they are also\npracticed. Instant social life and camaraderie. It need not be a competitive sport—it could be hiking,\nchess, or almost anything that keeps your nose out of a textbook and you out of your apartment. Sports\njust happen to be excellent for avoiding foreign-language stage fright and developing lasting friendships\nwhile still sounding like Tarzan.\nLanguage learning deserves special mention. It is, bar none, the best thing you can do to hone clear\nthinking.\nQuite aside from the fact that it is impossible to understand a culture without understanding its\nlanguage, acquiring a new language makes you aware of your own language: your own thoughts. The\nbenefits of becoming fluent in a foreign tongue are as underestimated as the difficulty is overestimated.\nThousands of theoretical linguists will disagree, but I know from research and personal experimentation\nwith more than a dozen languages that (1) adults can learn languages much faster than children 83 when\nconstant 9–5 work is removed and that (2) it is possible to become conversationally fluent in any\nlanguage in six months or less. At four hours per day, six months can be whittled down to less than three\nmonths. It is beyond the scope of this book to explain applied linguistics and the 80/20 of language\nlearning, but resources and complete how-to guides can be found under “language” at\nwww.fourhourblog.com. I learned six languages after failing Spanish in high school, and you can do the\nsame with the right tools.\nGain a language and you gain a second lens through which to question and understand the world.\nCursing at people when you go home is fun, too.\nDon’t miss the chance to double your life experience.\nService for the Right Reasons: To Save the Whales, or Kill Them\nand Feed the Children?\nMorality is simply the attitude we adopt toward people we personally dislike.\n—OSCAR WILDE\nOne would expect me to mention service in this chapter, and here it is. Like all before it, the twist is\na bit different. Service to me is simple: doing something that improves life besides your own. This is not\nthe same as philanthropy. Philanthropy is the altruistic concern for the well-being of mankind—human\nlife. Human life has long been focused on the exclusion of the environment and the rest of the food\nchain, hence our current race to imminent extinction. Serves us right. The world does not exist solely for\nthe betterment and multiplication of mankind.\nBefore I start chaining myself to trees and saving the dart frogs, though, I should take my own advice:\nDo not become a cause snob.\nHow can you help starving children in Africa when there are starving children in Los Angeles? How\ncan you save the whales when homeless people are freezing to death? How does doing volunteer\nresearch on coral destruction help those people who need help now?\nChildren, please. Everything out there needs help, so don’t get baited into “my cause can beat up your\ncause” arguments with no right answer. There are no qualitative or quantitative comparisons that make\nsense. The truth is this: Those thousands of lives you save could contribute to a famine that kills millions,\nor that one bush in Bolivia that you protect could hold the cure for cancer. The downstream effects are\nunknown. Do your best and hope for the best. If you’re improving the world—however you define that—\nconsider your job well done.\nService isn’t limited to saving lives or the environment either. It can also improve life. If you are a\nmusician and put a smile on the faces of thousands or millions, I view that as service. If you are a mentor\nand change the life of one child for the better, the world has been improved. Improving the quality of life\nin the world is in no fashion inferior to adding more lives.\nService is an attitude.\nFind the cause or vehicle that interests you most and make no apologies.\nQ&A: QUESTIONS AND ACTIONS\nAdults are always asking kids what they want to be when they grow up because they are\nlooking for ideas.\n—PAULA POUNDSTONE\nThe miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green earth, dwelling deeply\nin the present moment and feeling truly alive.\n—THICH NHAT HANH\nBut I can’t just travel, learn languages, or fight for one cause for the rest of my life! Of course you\ncan’t. That’s not my suggestion at all. These are just good “life hubs”—starting points that lead to\nopportunities and experiences that otherwise wouldn’t be found.\nThere is no right answer to the question “What should I do with my life?” Forget “should” altogether.\nThe next step—and that’s all it is—is pursuing something, it matters little what, that seems fun or\nrewarding. Don’t be in a rush to jump into a full-time long-term commitment. Take time to find\nsomething that calls to you, not just the first acceptable form of surrogate work. That calling will, in turn,\nlead you to something else.\nHere is a good sequence for getting started that dozens of NR have used with success.\n1. Revisit ground zero: Do nothing.\nBefore we can escape the goblins of the mind, we need to face them. Principal among them is speed\naddiction. It is hard to recalibrate your internal clock without taking a break from constant\noverstimulation. Travel and the impulse to see a million things can exacerbate this.\nSlowing down doesn’t mean accomplishing less; it means cutting out counterproductive distractions\nand the perception of being rushed. Consider attending a short silence retreat of 3–7 days during which\nall media and speaking is prohibited.\nLearn to turn down the static of the mind so you can appreciate more before doing more:\nThe Art of Living Foundation (Course II)—International—( www.artofliving.org )\nSpirit Rock Meditation Center in California ( http://www.spiritrock.org )\nKripalu Center for Yoga and Health in Massachusetts ( http://www.kripalu.org )\nSky Lake Lodge in New York ( http://www.sky-lake.org )\n2. Make an anonymous donation to the service organization of your choice.\nThis helps to get the juices flowing and disassociate feeling good about service with getting credit for it.\nIt feels even better when it’s pure. Here are some good sites to get started:\nCharity Navigator (www.charitynavigator.org)\nThis independent service ranks more than 5,000 charities using criteria you select. Create a personalized\npage of favorites and compare them side by side, all free of charge.\nFirstgiving (www.firstgiving.com)\nFirstgiving.com allows you to create an online fund-raising page. Donations can be made through your\npersonal URL. I have used Firstgiving in coordination with a nonprofit called Room to Read to build\nschools in both Nepal and Vietnam, with more countries pending: www.firstgiving.com/timferriss and\nwww.firstgiving.com/timferriss2. If you specifically want to help animals, for example, you can click on\na related link and access websites for hundreds of different animal charities, and then decide which one\nyou want to donate to. The UK version of the website is http://www.justgiving.com.\nNetwork for Good (www.networkforgood.org)\nVisitors to this website will find links to charities in need of donations as well as opportunities to do\nvolunteer work. They can also set up an automated credit card donation online.\n3. Take a learning mini-retirement in combination with local volunteering.\nTake a mini-retirement—six months or more if possible—to focus on learning and serving. The longer\nduration will permit a language focus, which in turn enables more meaningful interaction and\ncontribution through volunteering.\nFor the duration of this trip, note self-criticisms and negative self-talk in a journal. Whenever upset or\nanxious, ask “why” at least three times and put the answers down on paper. Describing these doubts in\nwriting reduces their impact twofold. First, it’s often the ambiguous nature of self-doubt that hurts most.\nDefining and exploring it in writing—just as with forcing colleagues to e-mail—demands clarity of\nthought, after which most concerns are found to be baseless. Second, recording these concerns seems to\nsomehow remove them from your head.\nBut where to go and what to do? There is no one right answer to either. Use the following questions\nand resources to brainstorm:\nWhat makes you most angry about the state of the world?\nWhat are you most afraid of for the next generation, whether you have children or not?\nWhat makes you happiest in your life? How can you help others have the same?\nThere is no need to limit yourself to one location. Remember Robin, who traveled through South\nAmerica for a year with her husband and seven-year-old son? The three of them spent one to two\nmonths doing volunteer work in each location, including building wheelchairs in Banos, Ecuador,\nrehabilitating exotic animals in the Bolivian rain forest, and shepherding leather-back sea turtles in\nSuriname.\nHow about doing archaeological excavation in Jordan or tsunami relief on the islands of Thailand?\nThese are just two of the dozens of foreign relocation and volunteering case studies in each issue of\nVerge Magazine (www.vergemagazine.com). Reader-tested resources include:\nHands on Disaster Response: www.hodr.org\nProject Hope: www.projecthope.org\nRelief International: www.ri.org\nInternational Relief Teams: www.irteams.org\nAirline Ambassadors International: www.airlineamb.org\nAmbassadors for Children:\nwww.ambassadorsforchildren.org\nRelief Riders International:\nwww.reliefridersinternational.com\nHabitat for Humanity Global Village Program:\nwww.habitat.org\nPlaneta: Global Listings for Practical Ecotourism:\nwww.planeta.com\n4. Revisit and reset dreamlines.\nFollowing the mini-retirement, revisit the dreamlines set in Definition and reset them as needed. The\nfollowing questions will help:\nWhat are you good at?\nWhat could you be the best at?\nWhat makes you happy?\nWhat excites you?\nWhat makes you feel accomplished and good about yourself?\nWhat are you most proud of having accomplished in your life? Can you repeat this or further develop\nit?\nWhat do you enjoy sharing or experiencing with other people?\n5. Based on the outcomes of steps 1–4, consider testing new part- or full-time vocations.\nFull-time work isn’t bad if it’s what you’d rather be doing. This is where we distinguish “work” from a\n“vocation.”\nIf you have created a muse or cut your hours down to next to nothing, consider testing a part-time or\nfull-time vocation: a true calling or dream occupation. This is what I did with this book. I can now tell\npeople I’m a writer rather than giving them the two-hour drug dealer explanation. What did you dream of\nbeing when you were a kid? Perhaps it’s time to sign up for Space Camp or intern as an assistant to a\nmarine biologist.\nRecapturing the excitement of childhood isn’t impossible. In fact, it’s required. There are no more\nchains—or excuses—to hold you back.\n81. Abraham Maslow, the American psychologist famous for proposing “Mas-low’s Hierarchy of\nNeeds,” would term this goal a “peak experience.”\n82. There is a place for koans and rhetorical meditative questions, but these tools are optional and\noutside the scope of this book. Most questions without answers are just poorly worded.\n83. Ellen Bialystok and Kenji Hakuta, In Other Words: The Science and Psychology of Second-\nLanguage Acquisition (Basic Books, 1995).\nThe Top 13 New Rich Mistakes\nIf you don’t make mistakes, you’re not working on hard enough problems. And that’s a big\nmistake.\n—FRANK WILCZEK, 2004 Nobel Prize winner in physics\nHo imparato che niente e impossibile, e anche che quasi niente e facile … (I’ve learned that\nnothing is impossible, and that almost nothing is easy …)\n—ARTICOLO 31 (Italian rap group), “Un Urlo”\nMistake are the name of the game in lifestyle design. It requires fighting impulse after impulse\nfrom the old world of retirement-based life deferral. Here are the slipups you will make. Don’t get\nfrustrated. It’s all part of the process.\n1. Losing sight of dreams and falling into work for work’s sake (W4W) Please reread the\nintroduction and next chapter of this book whenever you feel yourself falling into this trap. Everyone\ndoes it, but many get stuck and never get out.\n2. Micromanaging and e-mailing to fill time Set the responsibilities, problem scenarios and rules, and\nlimits of autonomous decision-making—then stop, for the sanity of everyone involved.\n3. Handling problems your outsourcers or co-workers can handle\n4. Helping outsourcers or co-workers with the same problem more than once, or with noncrisis\nproblems Give them if-then rules for solving all but the largest problems. Give them the freedom to act\nwithout your input, set the limits in writing, and then emphasize in writing that you will not respond to\nhelp with problems that are covered by these rules. In my particular case, all outsourcers have at their\ndiscretion the ability to fix any problem that will cost less than $400. At the end of each month or\nquarter, depending on the outsourcer, I review how their decisions have affected profit and adjust the\nrules accordingly, often adding new rules based on their good decisions and creative solutions.\n5. Chasing customers, particularly unqualified or international prospects, when you have sufficient\ncash flow to finance your nonfinancial pursuits\n6. Answering e-mail that will not result in a sale or that can be answered by a FAQ or autoresponder\nFor a good example of an auto-responder that directs people to the appropriate information\nand outsourcers, e-mailinfo@fourhourworkweek.com.\n7. Working where you live, sleep, or should relax Separate your environments—designate a single\nspace for work and solely work—or you will never be able to escape it. 84\n8. Not performing a thorough 80/20 analysis every two to four weeks for your business and\npersonal life\n9. Striving for endless perfection rather than great or simply good enough, whether in your\npersonal or professional life Recognize that this is often just another W4W excuse. Most endeavors are\nlike learning to speak a foreign language: to be correct 95% of the time requires six months of\nconcentrated effort, whereas to be correct 98% of the time requires 20–30 years. Focus on great for a few\nthings and good enough for the rest. Perfection is a good ideal and direction to have, but recognize it for\nwhat it is: an impossible destination.\n10. Blowing minutiae and small problems out of proportion as an excuse to work\n11. Making non-time-sensitive issues urgent in order to justify work How many times do I have to\nsay it? Focus on life outside of your bank accounts, as scary as that void can be in the initial stages. If\nyou cannot find meaning in your life, it is your responsibility as a human being to create it, whether that\nis fulfilling dreams or finding work that gives you purpose and self-worth—ideally a combination of\nboth.\n12. Viewing one product, job, or project as the end-all and be-all of your existence Life is too short\nto waste, but it is also too long to be a pessimist or nihilist. Whatever you’re doing now is just a\nstepping-stone to the next project or adventure. Any rut you get into is one you can get yourself out of.\nDoubts are no more than a signal for action of some type. When in doubt or overwhelmed, take a break\nand 80/20 both business and personal activities and relationships.\n13. Ignoring the social rewards of life Surround yourself with smiling, positive people who have\nabsolutely nothing to do with work. Create your muses alone if you must, but do not live your life alone.\nHappiness shared in the form of friendships and love is happiness multiplied.\n84. To avoid the living room and coffee shop as offices, consider using a social “co-working” space\non occasion: http://coworking.pbwiki.com.\nThe Last Chapter\nAN E-MAIL YOU NEED TO READ\nThere is nothing the busy man is less busied with than living; there is nothing harder to learn.\n—SENECA\nFor the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: “If today\nwere the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?” And whenever\nthe answer has been “No” for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something …\nalmost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—\nthese things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.\nRemembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you\nhave something to lose.\n—STEVE JOBS, college dropout and CEO of Apple Computer, Stanford University\nCommencement, 2005 85\nIf you’re confused about life, you’re not alone. There are almost seven billion of us. This isn’t a\nproblem, of course, once you realize that life is neither a problem to be solved nor a game to be won.\nIf you are too intent on making the pieces of a nonexistent puzzle fit, you miss out on all the real fun.\nThe heaviness of success-chasing can be replaced with a serendipitous lightness when you recognize that\nthe only rules and limits are those we set for ourselves.\nSo be bold and don’t worry about what people think. They don’t do it that often anyway.\nTwo years ago, I was forwarded the following poem—originally written by child psychologist David\nL. Weatherford—by a close friend. He quit his own deferred-life plan after reading it, and I hope you\nwill do the same. Here it is.\nHave you ever watched kids\nOn a merry-go-round?\nOr listened to the rain\nSlapping on the ground?\nEver followed a butterfly’s erratic flight?\nOr gazed at the sun into the fading night?\nYou better slow down.\nDon’t dance so fast.\nTime is short.\nThe music won’t last.\nDo you run through each day\nOn the fly?\nSLOW DANCE\nWhen you ask: How are you?\nDo you hear the reply?\nWhen the day is done,\ndo you lie in your bed\nWith the next hundred chores\nRunning through your head?\nYou’d better slow down.\nDon’t dance so fast.\nTime is short.\nThe music won’t last.\nEver told your child,\nWe’ll do it tomorrow?\nAnd in your haste,\nNot see his sorrow?\nEver lost touch,\nLet a good friendship die\nCause you never had time\nTo call and say, “Hi”?\nYou’d better slow down.\nDon’t dance so fast.\nTime is short.\nThe music won’t last.\nWhen you run so fast to get somewhere\nYou miss half the fun of getting there.\nWhen you worry and hurry through your day,\nIt is like an unopened gift thrown away.\nLife is not a race.\nDo take it slower.\nHear the music\nBefore the song is over.\n85. http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html.\nLast but Not Least\nTHE BEST OF THE BLOG\nThe Art of Letting Bad Things Happen\n[AFTER 3 WEEKS OFF OF THE BLOG]\nLong time no see! I just landed back in California from a long overdue mini-retirement through\nLondon, Scotland, Sardinia, the Slovak Republic, Austria, Amsterdam, and Japan. Some unpleasant\nsurprises awaited me when I checked in on the evil e-mail inbox. Why? I let them happen.\nI always do.\nHere are just a few of the goodies that awaited me this time:\nOne of our fulfillment companies had been shut down due to the\nCEO’s death, causing a 20%+ loss in monthly orders and\nrequiring an emergency shift of all web design and order\nprocessing\nMissed radio and magazine appearances and upset would-be\ninterviewers\nMore than a dozen lost joint-venture partnership opportunities\nIt’s not that I go out of my way to irritate people—not at all—but I recognize one critical fact:\nOftentimes, in order to do the big things, you have to let the small bad things happen. This is a skill we\nwant to cultivate.\nWhat did I get in exchange for temporarily putting on blinders and taking a few glancing blows?\nI followed the Rugby World Cup in Europe and watched the New\nZealand All Blacks live, a dream I’ve had for the last five years.\nI shot every gun I’ve ever dreamed of firing since brainwashing\nmyself with Commando . Bless the Slovak Republic and their\nparamilitaries.\nI filmed a television series pilot in Japan, a lifelong dream and the\nmost fun I’ve had in months, if not years.\nI met with my Japanese publisher, Seishisha, and had media\ninterviews in Tokyo, where the 4HWW is now #1 in several of\nthe largest chains.\nI took a complete 10-day media fast and felt like I’d had a twoyear\nvacation from computers.\nI attended the Tokyo International Film Festival and hung out with\none of my heroes, the producer of the Planet Earth television\nseries.\nOnce you realize that you can turn off the noise without the world ending, you’re liberated in a way\nthat few people ever know.\nJust remember: If you don’t have attention, you don’t have time. Did I have time to check e-mail and\nvoicemail? Sure. It might take 10 minutes. Did I have the attention to risk fishing for crises in those 10\nminutes? Not at all.\nAs tempting as it is to “just check e-mail for one minute,” I didn’t do it. I know from experience that\nany problem found in the inbox will linger in the brain for hours or days after you shut down the\ncomputer, rendering “free time” useless with preoccupation. It’s the worst of states, where you\nexperience neither relaxation nor productivity. Be focused on work or focused on something else, never\nin-between.\nTime without attention is worthless, so value attention over time.\nHere are a few questions that can help you pop on the productivity blinders and put things in\nperspective. Even when you’re not traveling the world, develop the habit of letting small bad things\nhappen. If you don’t, you’ll never find time for the life-changing big things, whether important tasks or\ntrue peak experiences. If you do force the time but puncture it with distractions, you won’t have the\nattention to appreciate it.\nWhat is the one goal, if completed, that could change everything?\nWhat is the most urgent thing right now that you feel you “must”\nor “should” do?\nCan you let the urgent “fail”—even for a day—to get to the next\nmilestone for your potential life-changing tasks?\nWhat’s been on your to-do list the longest? Start it first thing in\nthe morning and don’t allow interruptions or lunch until you\nfinish.\nWill “bad” things happen? Small problems will crop up, yes. A few people will complain and quickly\nget over it. BUT, the bigger picture items you complete will let you see these for what they are—minutiae\nand repairable hiccups.\nMake this trade a habit. Let the small bad things happen and make the big good things happen. —\nOCTOBER 25, 2007\nThings I’ve Loved and Learned in 2008\n2008 was one of the most exciting years of my life. I did more dealmaking and met more people than\nin the last five years combined. This produced many surprise insights about business and human nature,\nespecially as I uncovered dozens of my own false assumptions.\nHere are some of the things I learned and loved in 2008.\nFavorite reads of 2008: Zorba the Greek and Seneca: Letters from a Stoic. These are two of the most\nreadable books of practical philosophies I’ve ever had the fortune to encounter. If you have to choose\none, get Zorba, but Lucius Seneca will take you further. Both are fast reads of 2–3 evenings.\nDon’t accept large or costly favors from strangers. This karmic debt will come back to haunt you. If\nyou can’t pass it up, immediately return to karmic neutrality with a gift of your choosing. Repay it before\nthey set the terms for you. Exceptions: über-successful mentors who are making introductions and not\nlaboring on your behalf.\nYou don’t have to recoup losses the same way you lose them. I own a home in San Jose but moved\nalmost 12 months ago. It’s been empty since, and I’m paying a large mortgage each month. The best\npart? I don’t care. But this wasn’t always the case. For many months, I felt demoralized as others\npressured me to rent it, emphasizing how I was just flushing money away otherwise. Then I realized:\nYou don’t have to make money back the same way you lose it. If you lose $1,000 at the blackjack table,\nshould you try and recoup it there? Of course not. I don’t want to deal with renters, even with a property\nmanagement company. The solution: Leave the house alone, use it on occasion, and just create incoming\nrevenue elsewhere that would cover the cost of the mortgage through consulting, publishing, etc.\nOne of the most universal causes of self-doubt and depression: trying to impress people you don’t\nlike. Stressing to impress is fine, but do it for the right people—those you want to emulate.\nSlow meals = life. From Daniel Gilbert of Harvard to Martin Seligman of Princeton, the “happiness”\n(self-reported well-being) researchers seem to agree on one thing: Mealtime with friends and loved ones\nis a direct predictor of well-being. Have at least one 2-to-3-hour dinner and/or drinks per week—yes, 2–\n3 hours—with those who make you smile and feel good. I find the afterglow effect to be greatest and\nlongest with groups of five or more. Two times that are conducive to this: Thursday dinners or afterdinner\ndrinks and Sunday brunches.\nAdversity doesn’t build character; it reveals it.\nRelated: Money doesn’t change you; it reveals who you are when you no longer have to be nice.\nIt doesn’t matter how many people don’t get it. What matters is how many people do. If you have a\nstrong informed opinion, don’t keep it to yourself. Try to help people and make the world a better place.\nIf you strive to do anything remotely interesting, just expect a small percentage of the population to\nalways find a way to take it personally. F*ck ’em. There are no statues erected to critics.\nRelated: You’re never as bad as they say you are. My agent used to send me every blog or media hit\nfor The 4-Hour Workweek. Eight weeks after publication, I asked him to only forward me positive\nmentions in major media or factual inaccuracies I needed to respond to. An important correlate: You’re\nnever as good as they say you are, either. It’s not helpful to get a big head or get depressed. The former\nmakes you careless and the latter makes you lethargic. I wanted to have untainted optimism but remain\nhungry. Speaking of hungry …\nEat a high-protein breakfast within 30 minutes of waking and go for a 10-to-20-minute walk\noutside afterward, ideally bouncing a handball or tennis ball. This one habit is better than a handful\nof Prozac in the morning. (Suggested reading: The 3-Minute Slow-Carb Breakfast, How to “Peel”\nHardboiled Eggs Without Peeling on www.fourhourblog.com.) I dislike losing money about 50x more\nthan I like making it. Why 50X? Logging time as an experiment, I concluded that I often spend at least\n50 x more time to prevent a hypothetical unit of $100 from being lost vs. earned. The hysterical part is\nthat, even after becoming aware of this bias, it’s hard to prevent the latter response. Therefore, I\nmanipulate the environmental causes of poor responses instead of depending on error-prone selfdiscipline.\nI should not invest in public stocks where I cannot influence outcomes. Once realizing that almost no\none can predict risk tolerance and response to losses, I moved all of my investments into fixed-income\nand cashlike instruments in July 2008 for this reason, setting aside 10% of pretax income for angel\ninvestments where I can contribute significant UI/design, PR, and corporate partnership help.

Opportunities abound in bad times as\nwell as good times. In fact, the opportunities are often greater when the conventional wisdom is that\neverything is going into the toilet.\nWell… we’re nearing the end of another great year, and despite what we read about the outlook for\n2009, we can look forward to a New Year filled with opportunities as well as stimulating challenges.\nHappy New Year, everyone.\nHow to Travel the World with 10 Pounds or Less\nHauling a five-piece Samsonite set around the planet is hell on earth. I watched a friend do this up\nand down dozens of subway and hotel staircases in Europe for three weeks, and—while I laughed a lot,\nespecially when he resorted to just dragging or throwing his bags down stairs—I’d like to save you the\nbreakdown. Trip enjoyment is inversely proportionate to the amount of crap (read: distractions) you bring\nwith you.\nPractice in 30-plus countries has taught me that minimalist packing can be an art.\nI returned from Costa Rica last Wednesday and have since landed in Maui, where I’ll stay for one\nweek. What did I pack and why? (See the companion video at www.fourhourblog.com. 86 )\nI practice what I’ll label the BIT method of travel: Buy It There.\nIf you pack for every possible contingency—better bring the hiking books in case we go hiking, better\nbring an umbrella in case it rains, better bring dress shoes and slacks in case we go to a nice restaurant,\netc.—carrying a mule-worthy load is inevitable. I’ve learned to instead allocate $50–200 per trip to a\n“settling fund,” which I use to buy needed items once they’re 100% needed. This includes cumbersome\nand hassle items like umbrellas and bottles of sunscreen that love to explode. Also, never buy if you can\nborrow. If you’re going on a bird-watching trip in Costa Rica, you don’t need to bring binoculars—\nsomeone else will have them.\nHere’s the Maui list.\n1 featherweight Marmot Ion jacket (3 oz.!)\n1 breathable Coolibar long-sleeve shirt to prevent sunburn. This\nsaved me in Panama.\n1 pair of polyester pants. Polyester is light, wrinkle-resistant, and\ndries quickly.

The problem with using a cell phone alarm to\nwake up is simple: The phone often needs to be on, and even if\nyou use vibrate, people can call and wake you up before you want\nto wake up. The second benefit to using a kitchen timer is that\nyou know exactly how much sleep you are—or aren’t—getting,\nand you can experiment with things like caffeine power naps of\ndifferent durations … but that’s another post;)\n—JULY 11, 2007\nThe Choice-Minimal Lifestyle: 6 Formulas for More Output and\nLess Overwhelm\nI was stressed out… over dog cartoons.\nIt was 9:47 P.M. at Barnes and Noble on a recent Saturday night, and I had 13 minutes to find a\nsuitable exchange for The New Yorker Dog Cartoons, $22 of expensive paper. Bestsellers? Staff\nrecommends? New arrivals or classics? I’d already been there 30 minutes.\nBeginning to feel overwhelmed with a ridiculous errand I’d expected to take five minutes, I stumbled\nacross the psychology section. One tome jumped out at me as all too appropriate—The Paradox of\nChoice: Why More Is Less. It wasn’t the first time I’d seen or read Barry Schwartz’s 2004 classic, but it\nseemed like a good time to revisit the principles, among them, that:\nThe more options you consider, the more buyer’s regret you’ll\nhave.\nThe more options you encounter, the less fulfilling your ultimate\noutcome will be.\nThis raises a difficult question: Is it better to have the best outcome but be less satisfied, or have an\nacceptable outcome and be satisfied?\nFor example, would you rather deliberate for months and get the 1 of 20 houses that’s the best\ninvestment but second-guess yourself until you sell it five years later, or would you rather get a house\nthat is 80% of the investment potential of the former (still to be sold at a profit) but never second-guess\nit?\nTough call.\nSchwartz also recommends making nonreturnable purchases. I decided to keep the stupid pooch\ncartoons. Why? Because it’s not just about being satisfied, it’s about being practical.\nIncome is renewable, but some other resources—like attention—are not. I’ve talked before about\nattention as a currency and how it determines the value of time.\nFor example: Is your weekend really free if you find a crisis in the inbox Saturday morning that you\ncan’t address until Monday morning?\nEven if the inbox scan lasts 30 seconds, the preoccupation and forward projection for the subsequent\n48 hours effectively deletes that experience from your life. You had time but you didn’t have attention,\nso the time had no practical value.\nThe choice-minimal lifestyle becomes an attractive tool when we consider two truths.\n1. Considering options costs attention that then can’t be spent on action or present-state\nawareness.\n2. Attention is necessary for not only productivity but appreciation.\nTherefore:\nToo many choices = less or no productivity\nToo many choices = less or no appreciation\nToo many choices = sense of overwhelm\nWhat to do? There are six basic rules or formulas that can be used:\n1. Set rules for yourself so you can automate as much decision making as possible [see the rules I\nuse to outsource my e-mail to Canada, included at the end of this section, as an example of this].\n2. Don’t provoke deliberation before you can take action.\nOne simple example: Don’t scan the inbox on Friday evening or over the weekend if you might\nencounter work problems that can’t be addressed until Monday.\n3. Don’t postpone decisions just to avoid uncomfortable conversations.\nIf an acquaintance asks you if you want to come to their house for dinner next week, and you know you\nwon’t, don’t say, “I’m not sure. I’ll let you know next week.” Instead, use something soft but conclusive\nlike, “Next week? I’m pretty sure I have another commitment on Thursday, but thank you for the invite.\nJust so I don’t leave you hanging, let’s assume I can’t make it, but can I let you know if that changes?”\nDecision made. Move on.\n4. Learn to make nonfatal or reversible decisions as quickly as possible.\nSet time limits (I won’t consider options for more than 20 minutes), option limits (I’ll consider no more\nthan three options), or finance thresholds (Example: If it costs less than $100 [or the potential damage is\nless than $100], I’ll let a virtual assistant make the judgment call).\nI wrote most of this post after landing at the monster that is ATL airport in Atlanta. I could have\nconsidered half a dozen types of ground transportation in 15 minutes and saved 30–40%, but I grabbed a\ntaxi instead. To use illustrative numbers: I didn’t want to sacrifice 10 attention units of my remaining 50\nof 100 total potential units, since those 10 units couldn’t then be spent on this article. I had about eight\nhours before bedtime due to time zone differences—plenty of time—but scarce usable attention after an\nall-nighter of fun and the cross-country flight. Fast decisions preserve usable attention for what\nmatters.\n5. Don’t strive for variation—and thus increase option consideration—when it’s not needed.\nRoutine enables innovation where it’s most valuable.\nIn working with athletes, for example, it’s clear that those who maintain the lowest bodyfat percentage\neat the same foods over and over with little variation. I’ve eaten the same “slow-carb” breakfast and\nlunch for nearly two years, 88 putting variation only into meals that I focus on for enjoyment: dinner and\nall meals on Saturdays. This same routine-variation distinction can be found in exercise vs. recreation.\nFor fat loss and muscle gain (even as much as 34 pounds in four weeks), I’ve followed the same time—\nminimal exercise protocol with occasional experiments since 1996. For recreation, however, where the\nfocus is enjoyment and not efficacy, I tend to try something new each weekend, whether climbing at\nMission Cliffs in San Francisco or mountain biking from tasting to tasting in Napa.\nDon’t confuse what should be results-driven with routine (e.g., exercise) with something enjoymentdriven\nthat benefits from variation (e.g., recreation).\n6. Regret is past-tense decision making. Eliminate complaining to minimize regret.\nCondition yourself to notice complaints and stop making them with a simple program like the “21-day\nno-complaint experiment” made famous by Will Bowen, where you wear a single bracelet and move it\nfrom one wrist to the other each time you complain. The goal is 21 days without complaining and you\nreset to 0 each time you slip up. This increased awareness helps prevent useless past-tense deliberation\nand negative emotions that improve nothing but deplete your attention.\nDECISION-MAKING ISN’T to be avoided—that’s not the problem. Look at a good CEO or top corporate\nperformer and you’ll see a high volume of decisions.\nIt’s deliberation—the time we vacillate over and consider each decision—that’s the attention\nconsumer. Total deliberation time, not the number of decisions, determines your attention bank\naccount balance (or debt).\nLet’s assume you pay 10% over time by following the above rules but cut your average “decision\ncycle” time by an average of 40% (10 minutes reduced to 6 minutes, for example). Not only will you\nhave much more time and attention to spend on revenue-generating activities, but you’ll get greater\nenjoyment from what you have and experience. Consider that 10% additional cost as an investment and\npart of your “ideal lifestyle tax,” but not as a loss.\nEmbrace the choice-minimal lifestyle. It’s a subtle and under-exploited philosophical tool that\nproduces dramatic increases in both output and satisfaction, all with less overwhelm.\nMake testing a few of the principles the first of many fast and reversible decisions. —FEBRUARY 6,\n2008\nThe Not-to-Do List: 9 Habits to Stop Now\n“Not-to-do” lists are often more effective than to-do lists for upgrading performance.\nThe reason is simple: What you don’t do determines what you can do.\nHere are nine stressful and common habits that entrepreneurs and office workers should strive to\neliminate. The bullets are followed by more detailed descriptions. Focus on one or two at a time, just as\nyou would with high-priority to-do items.\n1. Do not answer calls from unrecognized phone numbers.\nFeel free to surprise others, but don’t be surprised. It just results in unwanted interruption or poor\nnegotiating positions. Let it go to voicemail, and consider using a service like GrandCentral (you can\nlisten to people leaving voicemail or receive them as text messages) or Phonetag.com (receive voicemails\nas e-mail).\n2. Do not e-mail first thing in the morning or last thing at night.\nThe former scrambles your priorities and plans for the day, and the latter just gives you insomnia. E-mail\ncan wait until 10 A.M., after you’ve completed at least one of your critical to-do items.\n3. Do not agree to meetings or calls with no clear agenda or end time.\nIf the desired outcome is defined clearly with a stated objective and agenda listing topics/questions to\ncover, no meeting or call should last more than 30 minutes. Request them in advance so you “can best\nprepare and make good use of the time together.”\n4. Do not let people ramble.\nForget “How’s it going?” when someone calls you. Stick with “What’s up?” or “I’m in the middle of\ngetting something out, but what’s going on?” A big part of GTD (Getting Things Done) is GTP—Getting\nTo the Point.\n5. Do not check e-mail constantly—“batch” and check at set times only.\nI belabor this point enough. Get off the cocaine pellet dispenser and focus on execution of your top todo’s\ninstead of responding to manufactured emergencies. Set up a strategic autoresponder and check\ntwice or thrice daily.\n6. Do not over-communicate with low-profit, high-maintenance customers.\nThere is no sure path to success, but the surest path to failure is trying to please everyone. Do an 80/20\nanalysis of your customer base in two ways—which 20% are producing 80%+ of my profit, and which\n20% are consuming 80%+ of my time? Then put the loudest and least productive on autopilot by citing a\nchange in company policies. Send them an e-mail with new rules as bullet points: number of permissible\nphone calls, e-mail response time, minimum orders, etc. Offer to point them to another provider if they\naren’t able to adopt the new policies.\n7. Do not work more to fix overwhelmingness—prioritize.\nIf you don’t prioritize, everything seems urgent and important. If you define the single most important\ntask for each day, almost nothing seems urgent or important. Oftentimes, it’s just a matter of letting little\nbad things happen (return a phone call late and apologize, pay a small late fee, lose an unreasonable\ncustomer, etc.) to get the big important things done. The answer to overwhelmingness is not spinning\nmore plates—or doing more—it’s defining the few things that can really fundamentally change your\nbusiness and life.\n8. Do not carry a cell phone or Crackberry 24/7.\nTake at least one day off of digital leashes per week. Turn them off or, better still, leave them in the\ngarage or in the car. I do this on at least Saturday, and I recommend you leave the phone at home if you\ngo out for dinner. So what if you return a phone call an hour later or the next morning? As one reader\nput it to a miffed co-worker who worked 24/7 and expected the same: “I’m not the president of the U.S.\nNo one should need me at 8 P.M. at night. OK, you didn’t get a hold of me. But what bad happened?”\nThe answer? Nothing.\n9. Do not expect work to fill a void that non-work relationships and activities should.\nWork is not all of life. Your co-workers shouldn’t be your only friends. Schedule life and defend it just\nas you would an important business meeting. Never tell yourself “I’ll just get it done this weekend.”\nReview Parkinson’s Law and force yourself to cram within tight hours so your per-hour productivity\ndoesn’t fall through the floor. Focus, get the critical few done, and get out. E-mailing all weekend is no\nway to spend the little time you have on this planet.\nIt’s hip to focus on getting things done, but it’s only possible once we remove the constant static and\ndistraction. If you have trouble deciding what to do, just focus on not doing. Different means, same\nend. —AUGUST 16, 2007\nThe Margin Manifesto: 11 Tenets for Reaching (or Doubling)\nProfitability in 3 Months\nProfitability often requires better rules and speed, not more time. The financial goal of a start-up\nshould be simple: profit in the least time with the least effort. Not more customers, not more revenue, not\nmore offices or more employees. More profit.\nBased on my interviews with high-performing (using profit-per-employee metrics) CEOs in more than\na dozen countries, here are the 11 basic tenets of the “Margin Manifesto” … a return-to-basics call that\ngives permission to do the uncommon to achieve the uncommon: consistent profitability, or doubling of\nit, in three months or less.\nI review the following principles whenever facing operational overwhelmingness or\ndeclining/stagnating profits. Hope you find them useful.\n1. Niche Is the New Big—The Lavish Dwarf Entertainment Rule\nSeveral years ago, an investment banker was jailed for trade violations. He was caught partly due to his\nlavish parties on yachts, often featuring hired dwarves. The owner of the dwarf rental company, Danny\nBlack, was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying “Some people are just into lavish dwarf\nentertainment.” Niche is the new big. But here’s the secret: It’s possible to niche market and mass sell.\niPod commercials don’t feature dancing 50-year-olds, they feature hip and fit 20- and 30-somethings, but\neveryone and his grandmother wants to feel youthful and hip, so they strap on Nanos and call themselves\nApple converts. Who you portray in your marketing isn’t necessarily the only demographic who buys\nyour product—it’s often the demographic that most people want to identify with or belong to. The target\nisn’t the market. No one aspires to be the bland average, so don’t water down messaging to appeal to\neveryone—it will end up appealing to no one.\n2. Revisit Drucker—What Gets Measured Gets Managed\nMeasure compulsively, for as Peter Drucker stated, What gets measured gets managed. Useful metrics to\ntrack, besides the usual operational stats, include CPO (“Cost-Per-Order,” which includes advertising,\nfulfillment and expected returns, charge-backs, and bad debt), ad allowable (the maximum you can spend\non an advertisement and expect to break even), MER (media efficiency ratio), and projected lifetime\nvalue (LV) given return rates and reorder percent. Consider applying direct response advertising metrics\nto your business.\n3. Pricing Before Product—Plan Distribution First\nIs your pricing scalable? Many companies will sell direct-to-consumer by necessity in early stages, only\nto realize that their margins can’t accommodate resellers and distributors when they come knocking. If\nyou have a 40% profit margin and a distributor needs a 70% discount to sell into wholesale accounts,\nyou’re forever limited to direct-to-consumer … unless you increase your pricing and margins. It’s best to\ndo this beforehand if possible—otherwise, you’ll need to launch new or “premium” products—so plan\ndistribution before setting pricing. Test assumptions and find hidden costs by interviewing those who\nhave done it: Will you need to pay for co-op advertising, offer rebates for bulk purchases, or pay for\nshelf space or featured placement? I know one former CEO of a national brand who had to sell his\ncompany to one of the world’s largest soft drink manufacturers before he could access front-of-store\nshelving in top retailers. Test your assumptions and do your homework before setting pricing.\n4. Less Is More—Limiting Distribution to Increase Profit\nIs more distribution automatically better? No. Uncontrolled distribution leads to all manner of headache\nand profit-bleeding, most often related to rogue discounters. Reseller A lowers pricing to compete with\nonline discounter B, and the price cutting continues until neither is making sufficient profit on the\nproduct and both stop reordering. This requires you to launch a new product, as price erosion is almost\nalways irreversible. Avoid this scenario and consider partnering with one or two key distributors instead,\nusing that exclusivity to negotiate better terms: less discounting, prepayment, preferred placement and\nmarketing support, etc. From iPods to Rolex and Estée Lauder, sustainable high-profit brands usually\nbegin with controlled distribution. Remember, more customers isn’t the goal; more profit is.\n5. Net-Zero—Create Demand vs. Offering Terms\nFocus on creating end-user demand so you can dictate terms. Often one trade publication advertisment,\nbought at discount remnant rates, will be enough to provide this leverage. Outside of science and law,\nmost “rules” are just common practice. Just because everyone in your industry offers terms doesn’t mean\nyou have to, and offering terms is the most consistent ingredient in start-up failure. Cite start-up\neconomics and the ever-so-useful “company policy” as reasons for prepayment and apologize, but don’t\nmake exceptions. Net-30 becomes net-60, which becomes net-120. Time is the most expensive asset a\nstart-up has, and chasing delinquent accounts will prevent you from generating more sales. If customers\nare asking for your product, resellers and distributors will need to buy it. It’s that simple. Put funds and\ntime into strategic marketing and PR to tip the scales in your favor.\n6. Repetition Is Usually Redundant—Good Advertising Works the First Time\nUse direct response advertising (call-to-action to a phone number or website) that is uniquely trackable\n—fully accountable advertising—instead of image advertising, unless others are pre-purchasing to offset\nthe cost (e.g., “If you prepurchase 288 units, we’ll feature your store/URL/phone exclusively in a fullpage\nad in…”). Don’t listen to advertising salespeople who tell you that 3, 7, or 27 exposures are needed\nbefore someone will act on an advertisement. Well-designed and well-targeted advertising works the first\ntime. If something works partially well (e.g., high response with low percentage conversion to sales, low\nresponse with high conversion, etc.), indicating that a strong ROI might be possible with small changes,\ntweak one controlled variable and microtest once more. Cancel anything that cannot be justified with a\ntrackable ROI.\n7. Limit Downside to Ensure Upside—Sacrifice Margin for Safety\nDon’t manufacture product in large quantities to increase margin unless your product and marketing are\ntested and ready for rollout without changes. If a limited number of prototypes cost $10 per piece to\nmanufacture and sell for $11 each, that’s fine for the initial testing period, and essential for limiting\ndownside. Sacrifice margin temporarily for the testing phase, if need be, and avoid potentially fatal\nupfront overcommitments.\n8. Negotiate Late—Make Others Negotiate Against Themselves\nNever make a first offer when purchasing. Flinch after the first offer (“$3,000!” followed by pure silence,\nwhich uncomfortable salespeople fill by dropping the price once), let people negotiate against themselves\n(“Is that really the best you can offer?” elicits at least one additional drop in price), then “bracket.” If\nthey end up at $2,000 and you want to pay $1,500, offer $1,250. They’ll counter with approximately\n$1,750, to which you respond: “I’ll tell you what—let’s just split the difference. I’ll overnight FedEx you\na check, and we can call it a day.” The end result? Exactly what you wanted: $1,500.\n9. Hyperactivity vs. Productivity—80/20 and Pareto’s Law\nBeing busy is not the same as being productive. Forget about the start-up overwork ethic that people\nwear as a badge of honor—get analytical. The 80/20 principle, also known as Pareto’s Law, dictates that\n80% of your desired outcomes are the result of 20% of your activities or inputs. Once per week, stop\nputting out fires for an afternoon and run the numbers to ensure you’re placing effort in high-yield areas:\nWhat 20% of customers/products/ regions are producing 80% of the profit? What are the factors that\ncould account for this? Invest in duplicating your few strong areas instead of fixing all of your\nweaknesses.\n10. The Customer Is Not Always Right—“Fire” High-Maintenance Customers\nNot all customers are created equal. Apply the 80/20 principle to time consumption: What 20% of people\nare consuming 80% of your time? Put high-maintenance, low-profit customers on autopilot—process\norders but don’t pursue them or check up on them—and “fire” high-maintenance, high-profit customers\nby sending a memo detailing how a change in business model requires a few new policies: how often and\nhow to communicate, standardized pricing and order process, etc. Indicate that, for those clients whose\nneeds are incompatible with these new policies, you are happy to introduce other providers. “But what if\nmy largest customer consumes all of my time?” Recognize that (1) without time, you cannot scale your\ncompany (and, oftentimes, life) beyond that customer, and (2) people, even good people, will\nunknowingly abuse your time to the extent that you let them. Set good rules for all involved to minimize\nback-and-forth and meaningless communication.\n11. Deadlines Over Details—Test Reliability Before Capability\nSkills are overrated. Perfect products delivered past deadline kill companies faster than decent products\ndelivered on time. Test someone’s ability to deliver on a specific and tight deadline before hiring them\nbased on a dazzling portfolio. Products can be fixed as long as you have cash flow, and bugs are\nforgiven, but missing deadlines is often fatal. Calvin Coolidge once said that nothing is more common\nthan unsuccessful men with talent; I would add that the second most common is smart people who think\ntheir IQ or resume justifies delivering late. —JUNE 24, 2008\nThe Holy Grail: How to Outsource the Inbox and Never Check E-\nmail Again\nWhat if you never had to check e-mail again? If you could hire someone else to spend countless\nhours in your inbox instead of you?\nThis isn’t pure fantasy. For the last 12 months, I’ve experimented with removing myself from the\ninbox entirely by training other people to behave like me. Not to imitate me, but to think like me.\nHere’s the upshot: I get more than 1,000 e-mails a day from various accounts. 89 Rather than spending\n6–8 hours per day checking e-mail, which I used to do, I can skip reading e-mail altogether for days or\neven weeks at a time … all within 4–10 minutes a night.\nLet me explain the basics, followed by tips and exact templates for outsourcing your own inbox.\n1. I have multiple e-mail addresses for specific types of e-mail (blog readers vs. media vs.\nfriends/family, etc.). tim@ … is the default I give to new acquaintances, which goes to my assistant.\n2. 99% of e-mail falls into predetermined categories of inquiries with set questions or responses (my\n“rules” document is at the bottom of this post—feel free to steal, adapt, and use). My assistant(s) checks\nand clears the inbox at 11 A.M. and 3 P.M. pst.\n3. For the 1% of e-mail that might require my input for next actions, I have a once-daily phone call of\n4–10 minutes at 4 P.M. pst with my assistant.\n4. If I’m busy or traveling abroad, my assistant leaves the action items in numerical order on my\nvoicemail, which I can respond to in a bullet-point e-mail. These days, I actually prefer the voice-mail\noption and find that it forces my assistant to be more prepared and more concise.\nEach night (or early the next morning), I’ll listen to my assistant’s voicemail via Skype and\nsimultaneously write out the next actions (1. Bob: Tell him that … 2. Jose in Peru: Ask him for … 3.\nSpeaking in NC: Confirm …, etc.) in a Skype chat or quick e-mail. How long does the new system take?\n4–10 minutes instead of 6–8 hours of filtering and repetitive responses.\nIf you only have one e-mail account, I recommend using a desktop program like Outlook or Mail\ninstead of a web-based program like Gmail for a simple reason: If you see new items in your inbox,\nyou’ll check them. Like they say in AA: If you don’t want to slip, don’t go where it’s slippery. This is\nwhy I have a private personal account that I use for sending e-mail to my assistant and communicating\nwith friends. It’s almost always empty.\nE-mail is the last thing people let go of. Fortune 500 CEOs, best-selling authors, celebrities—I know\ndozens of top performers who delegate everything but e-mail, which they latch onto as something only\nthey can do. “No one can check my e-mail for me” is the unquestioned assumption, or “I answer every\ne-mail I receive” is the unquestioned bragging right that keeps them in front of a computer for 8–12\nhours at a stretch. It’s not fun, and it keeps them from higher-impact or more rewarding activities.\nGet over yourself. I had to. Checking e-mail isn’t some amazing skill that you alone possess.\nIn fact, checking e-mail is like everything else: a process.\nHow you evaluate and handle (delete vs. archive vs. forward vs. respond) e-mail is just a series of\nquestions you ask yourself, whether consciously or subconsciously. I have a document called “Tim\nFerriss Processing Rules,” to which my assistants add rules when I send them a note via e-mail with\n“ADD TO RULES” in the subject. Over the course of a week or two with a virtual assistant (VA), you\nwill end up with an externalized set of rules that reflect how your brain processes e-mail. It often shows\nyou how haphazard your processing is. I’ve included my “rules” here to save you some time. A few tips:\n1. Setting appointments and meetings takes a lot of time. Have your assistant set things up for you in\nGoogle Calendar. I input my own items via my Palm Z22 or iCal, then use Spanning Sync and Missing\nSync for Palm OS to sync everything. On my überlight Sony VAIO, which I still use for travel, I use\nCompanionLink for Google Calendar. I suggest batching meetings or calls in one or two set days, with\n15 minutes between appointments. Scattering them throughout the week at odd times just interrupts\neverything else. (Update 2009: The Palm Z22 has been discarded, and I now use a 13-inch MacBook and\nBusySync to synchronize iCal with Google Calendar.)\n2. If you jump in your assistant’s inbox and answer anything, BCC them so they are aware that you\nhandled it.\n3. Expect small problems. Life is full of compromises, and it’s necessary to let small bad things happen\nif you want to get huge good things done. There is no escape. Prevent all problems and get nothing done,\nor accept an allowable level of small problems and focus on the big things.\nReady to jump in and test the holy grail? Here are the steps.\n1. Determine exactly which accounts you will use and how you want them to respond to (or just\ncategorize or purge) e-mail for you.\n2. Find a virtual assistant.\n3. Test for reliability before skill set. Have the top three candidates do something on tight deadline (24\nhours) before hiring them and letting them in your inbox.\n4. Use a probationary period of 2–4 weeks to test the waters and work out the problems. Again: There\nwill be problems. It will take a good 3–8 weeks to get to real smooth sailing.\n5. Design your ideal lifestyle and find something to do other than let your brain fester in the inbox.

Be Aware of them, and Be\nPunctual!\nIf Tim says “Call me back,” CALL HIM BACK, do not send an e-\nmail. This is an important point, as Tim does not always have e-\nmail access because he is traveling a lot.\nEven if it is late in the evening, he is up late, if he does not want to\nanswer his phone, he will not. But PLEASE call him back when\nhe asks you to. He much prefers a phone call to an e-mail.\nPurchase and read The Elements of Style regarding proper\ngrammar and punctuation.

SHE WILL ADVISE WHETHER PURCHASES CAN BE\nAPPROVED.\nQuestion and Answer (Preferences)\n1. How do you feel about joint ventures?\nI’m open to them, but my brand and respectability is #1. I will not do anything with anyone who\ncomes off as deceptive or amateur. “Make millions while you sleep in our super-insane foreclosure\nprogram!” on the website disqualifies someone. I cannot be associated with anyone who might be\nseen as a liar or snake-oil salesman. Just ask yourself: If the CEO of a well-known company saw\nthis, would he lose interest in speaking with me? If so, it won’t work.\nFor those who pass that criteria, what have they done already? I’m not looking for first-timers,\ngenerally, unless they have an excellent track record and reputation elsewhere.\n2. Do you focus solely on profit-generating tasks?\nNo. I also look for prestige (Harvard, government, etc.), wide exposure, as well as building\nnetworks with people who have world-class skills in some area.\n3. How do you handle spam?\nSpamArrest and Gmail. I have no problem with spam at this point.\n4. What is your optimal response rate (i.e., respond to all e-mails no later than 48–72 hours after\nreceived)?\nSame day. I’m bringing you on to respond quickly.\n5. Do you respond to any e-mails?\nYes, but I’ll want you to filter them first, respond to all you can, then mark the ones I should look\nat with the label “TIM” in Gmail. [Note earlier in this article how I am now asking VAs to leave\nto-do’s via voicemail.]\n6. Do you put in any events in your calendar?\nYes, but I expect I will move more and more to having you do it.\n7. Do we “manage” your items, or do you delegate? We are cool with both, but prefer to manage.:-)\nI’ll try to give the list to you to take care of. I NEED confirmations that you received the task (“on\nit—will be done at X P.M.” is enough) and like status updates on larger projects with milestones.\n8. Who is on your team?\nMe, the publishing team, and some PR folk at this point. I might have you get involved with my\nother businesses later, but that’s it for now.\n9. Who do we have to collaborate with on a regular basis?\nSee above. 90% me, then possibly my publicist(s), tech support and web staff, and my book agent.\nMore will come, I’m sure, but that’s it for now.\n10. Who calls the shots for you?\nYou can decide anything under $100. Use your judgment and report the decisions.\n11. Do you have “days” off (as in no business appts.)?\nLet’s shoot for no appointments on Fridays, but let’s play it by ear. [Update: I now only have\nappointments on Mondays and Fridays.]\n12. Who has been handling your appts. up until now?\nMe. I haven’t had any in-person meetings for close to four years. Things have changed with the\nbook:)\n13. Explain to us your “optimal” work week (i.e., how long between phone calls, how many meetings\nper week, travel preferences, etc.)?\nI go to bed late, so try and avoid calls before 10 A.M. pst when\npossible.\nTry and “cluster” phone calls and meetings so that I can bang\nthem out at the same time, as opposed to having one at 10 A.M.\n, another at 1 P.M ., and another at 4 P.M . Have them all in a row\nwith 15–20 minutes in between whenever possible. I’d like to\ndo phone calls before 1 P.M . pst when possible (so 10 A.M.-1 P.M\n.). Calls should be kept to 15–30 minutes, always with a\ndefined end time. If someone asks to “jump on the phone”\nwith me, send them something like: “To make the best use of\neveryone’s time, Tim likes to have a well-defined agenda\nwith objectives for a call before jumping on the phone. Can\nyou please send over some bullet points with what you’d like\nto cover and decide on the call?” Something like that.\n14. Do you like us to schedule personal items in with your business calendar (i.e., order your mother\nflowers for Mother’s Day, etc.)? Absolutely.\n15. What are “all” the e-mail addresses we respond to for you? See earlier text.\n16. Do you like us to respond as “you” or something like “client support for Timothy Ferriss.”\nThe latter, probably something like “Executive Assistant to Tim Ferriss” below your name—I’m\nopen to suggestions.\n17. How many times a day do you want e-mail checked?\nTwice should be fine to start. Let’s aim for a minimum of at 11 A.M. and 3 P.M. in your time zone.\n18. What are your working hours?\n10 A.M.-6 P.M. pst, then often 11 p.m.-2 A.M. pst. [Before you cry, “What happened to the fourhour\nworkweek?!” realize that “work hours” here could be replaced with “active and available-byphone\nhours.” I have lots of projects and do not preach idleness. I am VERY active. See the sixth\ncomment on this post on www.fourhourblog.com for more elaboration or reread the “Filling the\nVoid” chapter in this book.]\n19. Do you like using IM?Not really, unless it’s a scheduled discussion. Just leave yourself logged in,\nand I’ll log in if I need something. [I tend to use Skype chat these days, as it’s encrypted and I can\navoid a separate IM program.]\n20. Do you prefer a phone call or an e-mail to answer a quick question?\nPHONE CALL, absolutely. DO NOT e-mail me for anything urgent. I really follow my own\nadvice and don’t check e-mail that often.\n21. What is your favorite color?\nGreen like cedar leaves in July.\n22. Call at the end of every day (if) there is something that Tim needs to respond to in his e-mail.\n23. E-books: Tell them they can download the e-bookfromwww.powells.com.\n24. Label all e-mails from “Expert Click” for Tim. No need to respond or forward.\n25. All Linked-In e-mails can be archived or deleted as Tim receives notification of invites as soon as\nhe logs into his Linked-In account.\n26. For start-up inquiries in the health and wellness industry (or BrainQUICKEN start-up inquiries)\nplease see the templates in\nGmail titled: Congratulations and General Business Questions—BrainQUICKEN Templates.\n27. For language inquiries, please see the templates in Gmail titled: Reader Question on Language\nResources—Language Templates.\n28. When Tim types “dictate” in the e-mail response, this means that we can say to the recipient: As\nTim is traveling at the moment and not able to personally respond to your e-mail, I mentioned\nyour message while on the phone to him, and he asked me to dictate. This makes the process easier\nas we do not have to change the context of the person responding.\n[This is to avoid having an assistant convert my first-person “Please tell him that I …” to thirdperson\n“Tim says that he …”—providing shorthand for “cut and paste” saves hours of assistant\ntime.]\n29. If someone e-mail blasts a bunch of people and I am one of them, usually safe to ignore or delete.\nRead them carefully, of course, but if it says for example “a few influential people I know” or\nsomething like that then if someone can’t take the time to personalize for me, forget them. If Tim is\ncopied, of course, that’s a different story.\n30. Tim’s address is XXXX. THIS E-MAIL IS NOT TO BE DISTRIBUTED OR GIVEN TO\nANYONE. If you want to copy Tim on an e-mail, please use the BCC field, so that it remains\nprivate.\n31. Mark anyone from Princeton for me to look at (TIM label). [Note: I’ve since had to modify this\ndue to volume.]\n32. If I decline someone and they persist, give them one more reply—“Tim appreciates the persistence,\nbut he really can’t…” etc.—and then archive future requests. Use your judgment, of course, but\nthat’s the general rule. Some people don’t know when persistent turns into plain irritating.\n33. Please also create a rule to respond with “scheduled” for all items I send to be put in the calendar\n(when they’re put in the calendar). Missing calendar items can cause big problems, so this is a\ncheck and balance to confirm.\n34. No need to follow up with someone after a call has taken place unless Tim instructs otherwise, or\nthey request something from us.\n35. Send all speaking requests to XXXX and ensure that he confirms receipt. (However, also see items\n38 and 39).\n36. Foreign language requests (i.e., purchasing rights, if the book is available in a particular language,\netc.) send to [the appropriate person at my publisher].\n37. XXXX’s replacement at Random House is XXXX.\n38. Inquire with Tim first before booking any speaking gigs on a specific date, as he may be traveling.\n39. When booking appointments in the calendar, be sure to also ask which topics they would like to\ndiscuss, and put them in the calendar description for Tim so he can prepare. Also be sure to ask for\na backup phone number in case they are not able to reach Tim. [I almost always have people call\nme unless I am abroad, as this is another safeguard against missing appointments.]\n40. Put initials in the subject line of calendar events so we know who (which virtual assistant) put the\nitem in the calendar.\n41. Prepare inquiries for Tim before sending to him for his review, i.e., get their Alexa ranking,\npossible dates of the event, a link to past events they have held, their budget, other confirmed\nspeakers, etc. Then send this info to Tim for his review.\n42. Respond to PX Method inquiries with the following response:\nHi [name],\nThanks for your inquiry about the PX Method, however the PX Method page is designed as just\na template others can look at as a reference for testing their own product ideas.\nWe are not sure if or when Tim will offer the PX Method for sale, but there are no plans at this\ntime. We appreciate your inquiry nonetheless. Thanks!\n[I get quite a few e-mails from readers who do not see the disclaimer on the PX Method mockup\npage and thus attempt to order a product that isn’t ready to ship.]\n43. Download eFAX viewer to view Tim’s faxes. His fax number is: XXXX.\n44. Event or speaking inquiries can be responded to as such:\nThanks for your e-mail and for your invitation to Tim. In looking at the event online, I see that\nthe event is April X and X, 20XX in Portland, Oregon [for example]. Before I present this to Tim,\ncould you answer a few questions for me, so we can make a more informed decision?\nWould you like Tim to be at the entire event?\nHow long would the keynote presentation be? Or would it be a\nQ&A panel?\nDo you cover travel and accommodation along with a\nspeaker’s fee?\nWhat is your budget for keynote presentations?\nHave any other speakers confirmed to present?\nAs soon as I hear back, I can speak with Tim about the possibilities of making this happen.\nThanks again!\nWarmly,\n[Name]\nthis e-mail is: [] blogable [x] ask first [] private\n[name]\nExecutive Assistant to Timothy Ferriss\nAuthor: The 4-Hour Workweek\n(http://www.fourhourworkweek.com)\n(Random House/Crown Publishing)\nBio and Fun: http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog\n—JANUARY 21, 2008\nProposal to Work Remotely on a Contract Basis\nThis is the actual remote-work proposal reader Autumn Brookmire used successfully to move to\nArgentina while retaining her job and cutting back to 5–10 hours per week of work.\nAUTUMN BROOKMIRE July 2008\nBackground\nAfter working for the [company name] for more than two years, I have a great loyalty to the people and\nmission of this organization. I believe I have added a great deal of value to the organization in my\nposition as marketing coordinator. With my creative problem solving and my cost effective solutions I\nhave changed the way we produce and distribute our holiday cards and I’ve developed a contest to bring\nin more usable photos for our marketing and publications. I would like to propose continuing to perform\nthe following tasks for [company name], but on a contract basis, remotely. I plan to live in Argentina for\n6–12 months starting in September of 2008. My goals are to develop my fluency in the Spanish language\nand immerse myself in another culture and completely foreign environment so that I develop my skills in\nadaptation to new ways of thinking.\nI am more than happy to discuss different ways to make this possible and I have some suggestions if\n[company name] would be willing to consider them. We can test this arrangement for a few months to\nsee if it works for both of us, since that would make the most sense.\nRole #1: Graphic Design and Print Advertising Coordinator\nResponsibility:\nCreate timelines for print materials and coordinate with respective program teams.\nExpectations:\nPrint materials will be completed on time.\nResponsibility:\nCoordinate design projects with program directors and outside graphic artists/designers.\nExpectations:\nPrint materials designs are suitable for the audience, accurate, and appealing.\nPrint materials are professional quality and produced within set timelines.\nResponsibility:\nMaintain relationships with print vendors to minimize cost relative to time and quality in producing\nprogram print materials.\nExpectations:\nPrint materials are printed within the established budget, unless budget overages are specifically\napproved by the Director of Marketing.\nContract Solution:\nBy using e-mail and web-based programs such as\n*ConceptShare, I can continue to coordinate these design projects from a distance. I currently maintain\nrelationships with print vendors and designers at a distance so physical presence is not necessary for this\nto continue. For meetings with program directors and the marketing team, I would use a free video and\nphone conferencing service called *Skype. We usually meet once or twice to discuss changes to their\nmarketing materials and the rest of the process is continued through e-mail and ConceptShare.\nRole #2: Special Marketing Project Manager\nResponsibility:\nMaintain a collection of updated, appropriate marketing images.\nExpectations:\nImages needed for marketing materials and websites are anticipated and acquired.\nContract Solution:\nI am still able to complete this task remotely by doing images searches on web databases such as\n*iStockphoto.com. If the experiment with the *Seminar Photo Contest fares well, I could also manage\nthat process via the web using Aptify, e-mail, and Skype.\nResponsibility:\nIdentify and implement new opportunities to leverage marketing materials.\nExpectations:\nIdeas are researched for feasibility and effectiveness.\nChosen projects are designed and sent out within the budget and timeline.\nContract Solution:\nI would utilize e-mail and Skype to communicate any new ideas and opportunities to leverage marketing\nmaterials. I have recently proposed creating a one-page calendar of our program deadlines to distribute\nto our recent seminar alumni in a fall mailing. This way students will have an easy way to remember all\nof our deadlines for our programs and may potentially boost our number of applicants.\nRole #3: Web-based Marketing Coordinator\nResponsibility:\nContribute to online advertising efforts and track results.\nExpectations:\nOnline efforts are increasingly cost effective.\nMarketing Director is informed of web-based marketing results as requested.\nContract Solution:\nI am familiar with our online advertising efforts and can continue to help with this process from a\ndistance. I will be able to access Facebook Ads, Google Ads, Blog Ads and aid Keri in gathering and\nentering data. I have experience working with our Facebook and Google Ads and have created images\nfor Blog Ads in the past. Launching new Ads will be easily managed abroad.\nResponsibility:\nCompile collection of updated, appropriate web photos.\nExpectations:\nAttractive, updated photos will be available for program and marketing uses.\nContract Solution:\nAs stated above with the stock photo inventory, I am still able to complete this task remotely by\nconducting image searches on web databases such as iStockphoto.com. The Seminar Photo Contest will\nalso be used as a tool to aid in this compilation of images while I am abroad.\nIn order to more effectively track the cost of production of our print materials, I think [company name]\nwould find value in transitioning to a contract basis for this position. I have really enjoyed working at\n[company name] thus far and would like to continue working for this organization from a remote\nlocation. Thank you for your consideration of this proposal.\nExplanation of Software and Programs Mentioned:\n*ConceptShare—www.conceptshare.com, ConceptShare allows you to set up secure online workspaces\nfor sharing designs, documents, and video and invite others to review, comment, and give contextual\nfeedback anytime and anywhere without a meeting. [Company name] has used this site for a few months\nto test its usability and has also been tested on multiple computers in Argentina (thanks to my sister\ntesting it out for me while she was in Argentina).\n*Skype—www.skype.com, Skype is a free software that allows you to talk for free via the Internet. You\ncan also use Skype with regular phones to make calls internationally for a low rate of about .04 cents a\nminute. Skype also has video chatting capabilities and conference call capabilities for meetings. The\nsetup requires downloading the Skype software free) and buying a headset with microphone ($10) and\nwebcam ($ ranges) for each computer. I have tested this software with my sister and it works well for her\nin Argentina and for me here.\n*iStockphoto—www.istockphoto.com, iStockphoto is an Internet royalty-free image and design stock\nphotography website. This is one of the many sites I use to find photos for [company name]. We have\nalready used a few photos from this site for our marketing materials.\n*Seminar Photo Contest—This contest was created by me and developed with Keri as an experiment to\ncollect more relevant and usable photos for our marketing and publication efforts. Since we have found it\nto be a bit invasive to try and take the photos ourselves, we wanted to try a new approach to capture\nphotos for our needs. All participants of our Summer Seminars 2008 are able to submit photos they have\ntaken at their seminar with a chance to be rewarded with a $5 Amazon Gift Certificate for each image\nwe choose.\n86. This video explains how and why I pack the items in the list that follows. Links for all items are\nalso included.\n87. This company filed for Chapter 11 in June 2009.\n88.

I’m a musician based in Munich, Germany. I’m running my own label and it has\nbeen difficult to get it off the ground. While working on that, my creativity slowly decreased until I hit\nrock bottom (a couple of times).\nWhile it is still difficult to survive in the music industry I find it not hard at all now to do what I want\nto do. And that’s all I do. I do what I want to do. It includes being a father, making music, composing,\ntaking care of business, traveling, learning languages (mostly Italian), riding my bike, etc…. It’s all in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\n1. I read the book step by step for about two months from September/October 2008 (plus surfing your\nblog) and just made tabula rosa with my life. (Lots of brainvomiting on paper.)\n2. I started outsourcing things that bothered me most (and therefore kept hanging out in my to-do list\nthe longest). I outsourced:\nresearch, most of which is music-industry related (research\noutsourced saves about 2–3 hours/day)\nwebsite maintenance (social websites like Facebook, Myspace,\netc). I’m planning on doing most of my marketing through\nthese sites in 2009 and I’m on about 25+ sites as an artist.\nMy VA (getfriday.com, as recommended in your book) does all the updates and checks\nthe sites once a week to gather e-mail messages, comments, etc., filters them and sends me a\nreport once a week including all the details for me to respond to. (Saves about one to two\nhours/day.)\nphoto retouching for my press pics is done by elance (saved five\nhours of work time and about $500).\nmanagement of my mailing list for gig dates, album updates, etc.\n(Saves about one hour for each mailing.)\nI started testing muses (learning languages with music to sell\nonline). I’m still testing!\nI decided to open a publishing operation online for film companies\nto license music for film with just a mouse click, without having\nto negotiate deals for months. It will happen in 2009 (I start\ntesting soon). People are generally surprised and amazed that a\nperson who doesn’t seem to be very corporate (I look like a\nretired punk rocker, haha) outsources parts of his life and lives\nlike a millionaire (I guess we do although we’re far from it!).\nI realized that I could do it after I got the first positive feedback from my outsource VA. I got the\nresults of my project posted on elance and a day later I got the results. I went, yeah baby, this is MINE!\nThe biggest change is, that I now have my life under control. I take care of my little daughter (20\nmonths) half the day (second half, my wife takes care of her), I take care of business, and I take time to\ndo things I always wanted to do. Revenue-wise I’m pretty much the same I was before but I have a lot\nmore spare time and a clear head (so I guess I’ve gotten a lot richer!).\nI work whenever I want (no boss) about 24–30 hours/week (including office hours and music-studio\nhours) and what I do now is only what I really love to do. I’m still step-by-step optimizing efficiency to\nreduce office hours (currently about 10 hours/week). My dream is to dissolve my office altogether, go\npaperless, and basically only have my laptop as an office.\nI eliminated all work that has gotten me down or was wearing me out (eliminated an extra workload of\nabout 10 hours/week). I do not take on jobs (writing/producing music) unless I really love the project. I\neliminated all complainers and haters (saves my stomach).\nI just started my blog juergenreiter.com, “zen and the art of rockstarliving,” where I want to share the\nchanges I made to my life (mostly for musicians to see the light at the end of the tunnel).\nAnd I recorded an album of my music and for the first time in my life did all the lyrics myself! It’s\ngoing to be out in spring on my label ORkAaN Music+Art Productions.\nI’ll be on mini-retirement in New York this year for six weeks. I’ll be in Sicily to learn Italian for\nabout two weeks in May. I’ll be back in Sicily to travel the island by bike for another 2–3 weeks in\nSeptember. And am planning on going to either Mexico, Central America, or Australia in the winter.\nI learned to shave with a straight razor within about 30 minutes, which I wanted to do for years.\nShaving is a real exciting ritual now and a lot of fun! I will do a master course for coffee experts in April\n(I’m a coffee junky!) and become a “maestro del café.” I helped my wife quit her teaching job and fulfill\nher dream to run a cafe in Munich, Germany. It’s called Frau Viola and opened its doors in October\n2008. It is running great! (www.frauviola.wordpress.com)\nCan you measure all of that? I think it speaks for itself!\nThe general mindset of 4HWW has given me the calmness of being able to take time to play with my\ndaughter and enjoying my “free time” without getting the fear of missing out on something or wasting\nmy life. I’d say overall (with all the above-mentioned changes) my productivity increased at least 70%\nand doubt decreased by 80%.\nFor those just getting started:\n1. start small think big.\n2. identify what excites you vs. what bores you\n3. eliminate and focus on what excites you\n4. stick to what excites you no matter what people say. It’s your life, live it the way you know is right\nfor you.\n5. read 4-Hour Workweek, obviously! —J. REITER\nART LOVERS WANTED\nI saw my father work himself to the bone for 20 years as a garbage-man when we immigrated from\nMexico. As I looked at my life in April 2007 in a lonely hotel room after another endless week of travel\nfor my employer far from my family and those I love, I realized that at 33 I was on the same path to\nwork myself into the ground and give up on my lifelong dream of pursuing my love of music and theater.\nIn life there are no accidents and that night as I was checking an e-mail from an old friend he\nsuggested the 4HWW. I devoured the book in a few hours and began immediately to apply the key\nprinciples. When I told people about the book and about what I intended to do everyone said I was crazy.\nI focused most of my efforts on Dream-lining, Elimination, and Liberation. As an employee I wanted to\nfirst achieve liberation with a remote work arrangement. Despite several failed attempts I persevered\n(great lesson in negotiating) and was granted the opportunity to work remotely. This changed everything.\nI went from 9+ hours of work a day with weekly work-related travel to four hours a week, one week of\ntravel per month, and I managed to get a $10,000 raise and deliver 2x the productivity in my job from\nthe previous unproductive year.\nAs a result I now live with my once long-distance girlfriend in Seattle (my hometown). I spend my\nnewly found time pursuing my passion for music (I sing in a choir and write my own folk-rock music),\ntheater (I am performing in my first fully improvised 60-minute play this weekend), and fitness. I am\ntraining for my second marathon now.\nMost of my friends cannot believe that I can actually spend most of my time pursuing my love for the\narts and still make a full-time income on only four hours a week. The best part of this is that I have\nfound mentally the meaning of freedom. Reality is truly negotiable and now my reality is that I can\nspend endless hours enjoying the company of my father, who waited twenty years till he retired to enjoy\nthe freedom that I have found less than 24 months after reading The 4-Hour Workweek.\nAs an immigrant I want to spread the message that to succeed in America in the 21st century we must\nNOT work hard, instead we must follow the principles of the 4HWW and work smarter so that we can\ntruly achieve the New American Dream: Freedom to enjoy the most precious resource we have in life …\nour time on this earth.\n—I. BARRON\nPHOTO FINISH\nHey Tim,\nI wanted to tell you that your book, The 4-Hour Workweek, has been a true inspiration and lifechanging\nresource for me this year!\nI bought your book in November. Before then, I didn’t know what “workflow automation” was. I had\na part-time employee, but her work was actually creating more work for me. I would work until\nsometimes 3 A.M., and get up at 7. I’d tell you I wanted to travel, but the truth is that it seemed\nimpossible to me. I didn’t have time or money.\nI was listening to your audio book one day. I had been listening to each of the chapters, sometimes\nover and over again. I was jogging. I stopped in my tracks. I believe I was listening about a case study\nabout someone who sold music files over the Internet.\nI’m a photographer. Weddings mostly. I wondered how I could sell digital images over the Internet.\nThen I came up with a fantastic idea for a family photography company. I stopped right there, and\nreserved a website on my iPhone.\nTwo months later, I had a website, access to thousands of photographers across the country, and our\nfirst sale. Even better, I am now in the family photography business, and I never have to shoot myself.\nEven better +1, we are the first family photography business that doesn’t sell prints. Only digital files. It\nworked! I have now adopted this for my wedding photography as well. Other photographers are so\noffended, but I am making WAY more $, my costs are almost eliminated, and my time is free!\nI know the above is vague, but it’s not the point. The point is that now I work better, faster, I have two\nmore employees, I turned off my e-mail notifications on my computer and my iPhone, despite all of what\nit’s capable of, it doesn’t even ring. E-mail has been disabled. I just check it every so often to see what\ncalls I missed.\nToday, my fiance loves me because I come home in time for dinner and I leave my laptop at work. It’s\na life I never thought I’d be able to live. In the meantime, systems are working in my place and this year\nlooks to be a lot better, financially, than last.\nThen I decided it was time to try my first mini-retirement. The goal: ski the Swiss Alps and spend five\ndays in Switzerland and spend less than $1,000 total. I got a roundtrip ticket for about 500 bucks. My ski\npass for one day at Engelberg was $80. Lodging was free, thanks to your suggestion\nwww.couchsurfing.com, and I ate roasted chestnuts, brats, fish and chips and drank great beer all week\nlong. I did it!\nI am forever grateful, and am excited for more mini-retirements. Here’s to living during the best years\nof my life.\nP.S. I leave May 11 for a month-long work vacation to Italy (I have been hired to photograph two\nweddings in Siena). I plan on vacationing a LOT more than I will be working.\n— MARK CAFIERO, Photographer\nVIRTUAL LAW\nI used to work at a large Silicon Valley law firm, but one day I woke up and decided that I wanted to\ntravel for a year and learn a foreign language. Six weeks later I was living in Cali, Colombia—I’d never\nvisited Cali before and hardly spoke a word of Spanish, but that’s what made it exciting to me. Well,\nalmost two years later, I still spend 95%+ of my time living and working from Cali, Colombia (I recently\nbought a gorgeous apartment here that I could never afford if I lived in California). I also have a fulltime\nmaid/cook (well, five hours per day, five days per week), which costs me less than US $40 per\nweek!\nI started my own virtual law practice and then joined forces with my old boss. My U.S. number rings\nthrough to me wherever I am in the world (originally I’m from New Zealand so I travel back there a lot,\ntoo), and all my U.S. mail is delivered to Market Street, San Francisco, and scanned so I can view it\nonline. If I need to mail letters, I have another service which prints the letter and sends it within the U.S.\nso there are no international shipping delays.\nDefinitely use www.earthclassmail.com for mail receipt/scanning. They have different packages but\nit’s around $20-$30/month. You can also choose one or more P.O. boxes or physical addresses. My\nMarket Street address is actually an earthclassmail address.\nFor printing small letters and mailing within the U.S. I use www.postalmethods.com. It’s a little\nclunky at first but it’s fine when you get used to it. It’s very cheap since you only pay when you send (a\nfour-page letter works out to just over $1 including the postage).\nCome visit me sometime. Colombia is nothing like what you hear about—I feel a lot safer walking\naround late at night here than a lot of places in San Francisco. But don’t tell anyone, those of us living\nhere want to keep it a secret!\n—GERRY M.\nTAKING FLIGHT WITH ORNITHREADS\nTim—\nMy mentor gave me your book this past July and it had a tremendous impact on my life, its arrival\ncould not have had better timing. About the time I read it, I was a few weeks away from competing in\nmy first Olympic distance triathlon. I had trained for five months, felt and looked strong, but even more\nimportant the discipline and working toward a physical goal resulted in a creativity I hadn’t felt in years.\nI posted a competitive time in the event and felt so optimistic about my abilities that I signed up for a\nhalf ironman competition.\nRiding that high and following the principles of your book, I thought of dozens of ideas for\nproducts/businesses and am on the verge of launching the first of those ideas. It is a line of apparel called\nOrniThreads which will provide modern, scientific designs of birds to Gen-X and Gen-Y birders.\nThe reasons for focusing on this demographic are twofold:\n1. For my “day job,” I work at [company name]. I have learned a lot about their\naudience/membership, e.g., like the fact that there are 70 million Americans who actively bird (a\nstaggering statistic from the U.S. Fish & Wildlife svc). Birders are a passionate lot and their\ninterest only seems to grow over time—it never dies! They also tend to skew from the middle to\nupper class and are educated.\n2. I took an ornithology class this summer at Columbia University (where I am enrolled in a\nconservation biology program) and fell in love with the illustrations in my textbooks and wanted to\nsurround myself with these images.\nI am launching www.ornithreads.com in the next week or so and the first of my three designs are\nbeing printed as we speak.\nI have big aspirations for the company, but am just trying to get the first collection to customers and\nlearn as much as I can. Your book has been incredibly helpful in outlining the necessary steps I need to\ntake to succeed and hope that my idea has some legs (or wings) which translates into an automated\nincome.\nIf you are in NYC anytime soon—promoting your book or otherwise—I would love to meet you.\nSincerely, —BRENDA TIMM\nOFF-THE-JOB TRAINING\nI used concepts from the 4HWW to work remotely from August of ’08 until January of ’09. I went to\nPortugal, Europe, Spain, Sweden, and Norway surfing and snowboarding my brains out. Best part about\nit? I came home with three times as much money in the bank than I would have had if I continued the\nnormal 9 to 5. I work for [world-famous design company] as a software developer, and was able to put\nthe concepts to use and really change my life. I paired my iPhone + Fring (Fring is voice over IP on the\niPhone, it allows you to use one device for everything, and have a local number abroad).\nI spent four months prior to departure being sure to never be at my cube, but always be just around the\ncorner. I made a point to ALWAYS be available on Instant Messenger, so when people would walk over\nto my cube and look for me in person they would see I was somewhere else, then hop online and ask,\n“Where are you?” My response was always similar, just down the hall in the cafeteria … just down the\nblock at the coffee shop, or at co-worker X’s desk. After two months of this a magical thing happened:\nPeople always looked to get me via Instant Messenger and stopped dropping by my desk altogether. That\nallowed me to be 6,000 miles away without anyone noticing.\nSomething else to consider… how time zone affects remote work environments. I noticed, while in\nNorway (nine hours away), that it was the perfect amount of time. I was, in a sense, living in the future.\nMy day was almost over by the time my boss woke up … this allowed me to explore Norway’s fjords,\nmountains, and undiscovered frigid surf spots in complete peace and without ever having to worry about\ngetting a call from overseas. It was perfect … If I wanted, I could explore all day, come home and have\nsome dinner, then ichat with my boss for 20–30 minutes and check in. The few times he needed\nsomething urgently, he was able to give me work when he went to bed, and have it completed in the\nmorning when he woke up. —B. WILLIAMSON\nDOCTOR’S ORDERS\nHi Tim:\nHere’s my story …\nMy dream started about four years ago. I was in the process of taking my psychology licensing exam,\nand after speaking to a friend, decided that I would reward myself with a trip to South America. We\nwere both exhausted from our 9-to-5 (and sometimes 6, 7, or 8 p.m.) hospital and clinic jobs.\nI had traveled extensively throughout the United States and some parts of Europe, but I had never\nexperienced South American culture.\nMy trip there was absolutely fantastic and really opened my eyes to other ways of living and culture.\nDuring my trip, I spent a lot of time speaking to expatriates about how they used their retirement funds\nand pensions to live the lives of kings there. One thing was evident: Most of the expatriates who\nattempted to “set up a business” to help fund their lifestyle had failed miserably. I hypothesized that\nthere just wasn’t enough currency (pesos) in the marketplace to really sustain a “gringo”-oriented\nbusiness.\nAfter my trip, I told my friend that I needed to dedicate all my energies to developing a method of\nreceiving income from U.S. citizens while living elsewhere. VOIP had recently been introduced to the\nmarketplace and Internet service was improving in South America and other parts of the third world.\nThe business had to be based upon absolute mobility. I boiled the whole business down to two basic\nfunctions: reliable telephone via VOIP and high-speed Internet.\nAt the time I had a small research consultation practice where I was helping doctoral students on the\nphone and via e-mail to complete their dissertations, theses, and statistical analyses. I had a small\nwebsite that was getting traffic but I was relying on others for web and marketing services. I\nsubsequently learned more about search engine optimization and web marketing and eventually took\ncontrol of all web marketing and promotion of my website, http://www.ResearchConsultation.com,\nallowing me to expand my business substantially.\nDuring the next three years I conducted numerous “mobile tests” … traveling to Costa Rica, the\nDominican Republic, Venezuela, and Colombia in order to fine-tune my system of conducting business\nfrom abroad.\nI finally left my job last November, the day before Thanksgiving, vowing to never return to the\nmundane 9-to-5 structure. My job had even recently instituted a “bio-metric fingerprint” identification\nsystem where you had to “punch in and out” at the beginning and end of your hospital shift with your\nfingerprint to ensure that you were working your eight hours. This was just another sign that I had to\nleave.\nI now live in NYC and Colombia and travel to other parts of the world throughout the year: speaking\nto customers, managing my contractors (U.S. and Colombian) in order to acquire U.S. dollars while\nliving for a fraction of the cost abroad. I’m also developing other websites and businesses (community\nforums) that will hopefully be more automated, requiring less day-to-day interaction and monitoring.\nWell, that’s my story for now … today South America, tomorrow anywhere I can get a high-speed\nconnection (banda ancha)! My stress level has dropped significantly since leaving my old job and my\nquality of life has improved enormously.\nMy family and friends in NYC still think I’m out of my mind, and I continue to fully agree with\nthem…. —JEFF B.\nTHE 4-HOUR FAMILY AND GLOBAL EDUCATION\nTim,\nWe moved to a totally digital nomadic life traveling the world as a family in 2006, so we discovered\nyour book and ideas after we had begun and loved it! Our life has changed totally and is more fulfilling\nand much more simple. We are greener, leaner, healthier, happier, more connected.\nOther people thought we were absolutely nuts when we decided to do this in 2004/5, but now many of\nthose same people think we are smart and psychic.\nProblems finding a good school fit (despite having many award-winning excellent ones at our\ndisposal) was probably the most specific moment (John Taylor Gatto says it best on why schools do not\neducate) that helped us to change as well as wanting more time together and forecasting the\nhouse/economy crash coming.\nI think more families will be taking mini-retirements and living slower, traveling digital nomadic lives.\nIf you are away for months as a family, you need to be informed about all the wonderful educational\nopportunities which are actually richer than staying home (which few realize)!\nThere are a TON of fantastic resources like Classroom 2.0 and many innovative educators online. My\ndaughter just turned eight and is having a blast with her online course with John Hopkins\nUniversity/CTY and it is also a nice resource for friends. Today one can immerse deeply in one culture\nand still maintain one’s home culture. This is important information for families who still fear the\noutdated negatives on Third Culture Kids (TCK) based on studies from the fifties.\nMaya Frost 91 has excellent information about older kids and even a new paradigm when it comes to\ngoing to university. I think education is one of the things going through a total transition due to the\nInternet, and parents need this info to make important decisions.\nWe have had a fantastic experience in going to a local school in Spain that has allowed my child to\nimmerse very deeply in her second language, culture, and literature. More info (in the book) on local\nschools is needed and how to experience it as a family for months at a time.\nWe have used local people like a wonderful flamenco teacher for our child and we have also used\nonline sources like our piano teacher in Chicago who teaches our child in Spain via Skype.\nE-libraries are very important (especially with a child who is a voracious reader).\nHttp://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html is an excellent resource on language education with great\nbooks on raising a bilingual child, even if you are a monolingual!\n—SOULTRAVELERS3, a family living abroad and loving it\nFINANCIAL MUSING\nI graduated from Stanford University and started working in investment banking in July 2006, and, in\na sick way, almost enjoyed it at first. Yes, it was a terrible lifestyle and all, but I was learning a lot and\nmoving up very quickly. I have (had) a type-A personality, so it appealed to me on some level.\nAs the year progressed, though, I realized it wasn’t sustainable and that I wanted out… but like so\nmany other people, I failed to take action immediately.\nIn May 2007, I was driving home at 3 A.M. one night after having pulled 4–5 all-nighters previously,\nand crashed into a tree on the side of the road. If you’ve never crashed into an inanimate object while\nasleep at the wheel, just imagine waking up five feet from the ground while bungee jumping as the cord\nis about to snap to get an idea of what it feels like.\n“At the ER”\nThat was the subject line of the e-mail I sent out the next day to my entire office. Luckily, everyone\nunderstood and told me to take a rare three-day weekend. Luckily I survived with no major injuries, but\nat that point I decided it was time for a change.\nI met up with some friends for dinner a week or two later and relayed my story. One friend there (who\nrecently quit her job to pursue professional acting—her dream—while selling information products\nonline) told me about this book she recently read called The 4-Hour Workweek.\nI thought it was a scam, of course, but I really hated my life and decided I needed to check it out at the\nvery least. I read it in one sitting. And then I read it again, just to make sure I wasn’t hallucinating.\nBefore ever getting into finance, I had done some work online with graphics and web design and I had a\ntechnical background, so nothing in the book seemed outrageous to me—I just didn’t realize how easy\nand accessible it all was. Also, I had lived in Japan for half a year in college and loved it—and long-term\nworld travel had always been one of my goals.\nI sat on the ideas in your book for a while, took a quick vacation to return to Japan in October 2007,\nand when I came back decided that I had to get started. My muse: sell an investment banking interview\nguide. It’s a niche, high-demand subject and I knew I could make a better guide than anything else out\nthere. One problem: I had to stay anonymous since I was still working, and advertising with Pay-Per-\nClick would be way too expensive given the high CPCs for related keywords.\nIn November 2007 I decided to start a blog, Mergers & Inquisitions\n(http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com), about the investment banking industry and how to break in,\naimed at a mix of college students, MBAs, and working professionals. While I built my audience, I\nnever had the time to finish my muse—the interview guide. But I was getting tons of requests to do\nconsulting from my readers, so I started with resume editing and expanded into mock interviews—yes,\nnot very “muse-like” but I charged high rates and could make my old salary in a fraction of the time. I\ndid this ALL while staying completely anonymous out of necessity—because I didn’t want to get fired\nwithout an alternative income stream. Amazingly, my services took off even though I couldn’t tell\nanyone who I was.\nAt the same time, I decided I would not get another job in finance, and would instead leave in June\n2008. So I had a very short amount of time to make everything work. Almost every single one of my\nfriends, roommates, and family doubted me and said it would never work. I decided they were all wrong\nand I would just do it anyway—worst-case scenario, I could always reduce my expenses and move to\nThailand to teach English.\nTo boost my income, I completely revamped my site to sell more of my offerings, which took me\nfrom pocket change to full-time income from part-time consulting over July-August 2008. This allowed\nme to travel to Hawaii and Aruba to go snorkeling, surfing, and shark-cage-diving and visit friends in\nother parts of the U.S. all while making an investment banker’s income from part-time work.\nAs the recession and economy worsened, my business picked up because it was counter-cyclical—\nanything that helps people find jobs is in huge demand in a poor economy. I’ve since helped scores of\nlaid-off bankers and other financiers find work elsewhere. However, I was also starting to work a lot\nmore because I was effectively trading time for money … so over the fall I started to work on my\noriginal product idea—my interview guide—and released it to great success later in 2008.\nIt has gone on to free up a ton of time, double my revenues, and put the majority of my income on\nautopilot. If I didn’t do any further work from this point onward, I could make 2–3x my previous\nmonthly income simply by writing once or twice a week for my site (4–5 hours) and doing limited\nconsulting on the side (10 hours). So you could say I’ve increased my income almost 3x while reducing\nmy hours 6x-9x and making myself completely mobile.\nI admit that often I do “work” more than this, but it’s all on related educational projects that I want to\nwork on, not anything that I have to work on. And if I don’t feel like working one week, I can reduce my\nhours to the 5–15 hour range and spend my time on learning languages, sports, or traveling to exotic\ndestinations.\nThis setup allowed me to take an amazing trip to China, Singapore, Thailand, and Korea in December-\nJanuary and get in some ridiculous adventures. I’ll be moving to Asia in a few months and after that,\ntraveling the world indefinitely while running my business from coffee shops.\nIncidentally, I met up with a lot of customers in Asia who thought this was the coolest thing ever!\nYour book has changed my life and infinitely improved my lifestyle, and I just wanted to thank you\nfor everything.\n—B. DECHESARE\nWHO SAYS KIDS HOLD YOU BACK?\nMy first action was to think “what is the worst that can happen on a scale of 1–10” if I quit my wellpaid,\nvery secure government job? The power of this thought process is incredible.\nI quit my job, sold my house, and went camping for three months with two kids under two and a half\nand a pregnant wife (mini-retirement). We (very slowly) drove the SE coast of Australia from Sydney to\nAdelaide.\nWith the complete clarity of mind that comes from being in a field with your family with no\nimmediate worries, I put into action a plan that I had been tinkering with for 12 months. I bought a\nwireless Internet dongle and created an info product for electrical engineers, and wrote some software to\ngo with it.\nManaged this by (a) going on info diet, (b) working 9 p.m.-midnight in a campsite with no other\ndistractions, (c) outsourcing everything that I would find difficult or time consuming (like the tricky\nprogramming stuff and the illustrations for my book).\nAfter about four weeks I had an automated informational website that had replaced ½ of my full-time\nincome—requiring > four hours per week to maintain.\nThe original plan was to arrive in Adelaide and get a J.O.B. But with my passive income, I decided to\nsimply grow my new business and am currently very close to replacing 100% of my previous income. It\nfeels f&*#ing brilliant.\nNow we plan to travel the world slowly until the kids are ready for primary school…\nWho says kids hold you back?! —FINN\nWORKING REMOTELY\nOne month and one year ago, I read 4HWW on the recommendation of my sister’s boyfriend after I\nhad been talking for months about changing my life drastically and moving to Argentina to learn\nCastellano. After reading the book I stopped talking about my dreams and immediately started setting\nshort-term and long-term goals. I bought a notebook to track my monthly goals and tasks. I did lots of\nresearch on potential remote working situations and I started telling my close friends and family about\nmy new plans. Everyone that I told thought it was just an idea and I wasn’t actually going to go through\nwith it. They thought it was a “some day I’d like to do this” idea and that I wasn’t actually setting daily\ngoals to get me there. They knew that I loved my job so why would I leave it for a life of uncertainty? I\ndidn’t think of it that way. I wasn’t scared, I was excited at the prospect of a new way of life, a fresh\nstart, and even though I loved my job I also had other things I wanted to accomplish in my life. At first I\nthought about teaching English to make a living down there, but deep down inside all I really wanted to\ndo was continue working for my current company, just doing it remotely. The book gave me the\nconfidence to think this was actually possible, when everyone around me thought it was impossible.\nI decided to write up a proposal 92 and present it to my boss even at the advice not to do it from\neveryone I knew. If my boss rejected my proposal, I had enough money saved up to live in Argentina for\nat least six months to get me by until I could figure out how I wanted to make money there. I was not\ngiving up on my dream of living a freer, happier life with less work and more time for myself. All odds\nwere against me but I took a calculated risk and had faith in myself. After I handed in my proposal, I\nwas ready to expect the worst. Everyone around me was waiting with baited breath and words of\nencouragement after I got rejected. When I left the meeting with my boss I couldn’t believe it. She\naccepted and was eager to talk to me about the details. She even had a smile on her face and told me how\nawesome my proposal was. No one else could believe it when I told them. After the shock wore off, I\nrealized that I could actually do this, and a huge weight was lifted from my shoulders. The hardest part\nwas over and now I could start thinking of more possibilities for my new life.\nI set my goal to move to Argentina for September 2008. I arrived here on September 3 and have been\nhere for about six months now. I live in the capital city of Jujuy, Argentina, a small province in the\nnorthwest of Argentina. I work about 5–10 hours a week and I find that I am much more focused now\nthat I am out of the office and working alone. I have a private Spanish tutor that I meet with for two\nhours, five days a week. I have a handful of friends that I spend time with, practicing my Spanish. I go to\nthe gym three times a week and go to yoga two times a week—something I didn’t do in the States\nbecause I didn’t have enough time. I eat healthier because I have more time to focus on what to eat. I\nhave more time to dream up bigger things that I want to do with my new free time. I have dreams of\nowning a bar or cafe, so maybe a few years from now that will be my next endeavor.\nMy advice to 4HWW readers is to take from my experience. I rely heavily on the advice of my friends\nand family, but sometimes you have to ignore the advice of your loved ones to really make some thing\nhappen. If you believe the impossible can be made possible, it will happen. —A.K. BROOKMIRE\nKILLING YOUR BLACKBERRY\nI’m a 37-year-old Subway franchisee owning and operating 13 stores. Been doing this for seven years.\nPrior to reading 4HWW I was KING at W4W (translate: work for work’s sake)! I’d never given myself\n“permission” to behave differently than I did as an employee in the past. 4HWW was absolutely\nliberating for me. I literally “caught myself” and began the process of curing my addiction to W4W. I\nused to always be “on” and I was never really “present” anywhere—too busy doing the “blackberry\nprayer” at the dinner table instead of spending quality time with those who were present. Holidays were\njust a remote office for battling the e-mail tsunami. 4HWW gave me a new paradigm and I began to\nlook at my business as a “product,” the (original) purpose of which was to provide me with a\ndisproportionate amount of income vs. time invested personally by me—to what end? To ENJOY\nMYSELF and to have complete autonomy over my schedule and activities. So I got off my own back,\ntold myself it was OK to pursue the original purpose and here’s what I did:\nCrunched my “always open” workweek into four days and 20 hours. I immediately began taking\nMondays OFF, giving me a nice three-day weekend. (Fridays are in the “CROSSHAIRS” next!) Tuesday\nto Friday I work 11 A.M.-4 p.m. (20 hours per week). With the “unluxury” of time in this crunched\nworkweek I was forced to appraise everything through the 80/20 filter and found that 50% of the 80%\nwas pure crap and the other 50% of the 80% could be done by someone on my payroll. Great!\nEverything I do now has to somehow either increase sales or decrease costs otherwise “it’s someone\nelse’s job.” You can’t be “half-pregnant,” so when I’m “on” I’m really on and when I’m “off” I’m off—\ngood luck trying to contact me. I still carry portable e-mail but I’ve killed “auto-sync” (the bane of\nmodern mankind in terms of interruption) now it’s on a Tues-Fri, 11 A.M.-4 p.m. schedule. Outside of\nthat window it waits.\nMy e-mail autoresponder eliminated 50% of my e-mail within two weeks as people sending me\nmeaningless crap got fed up looking at my autoresponder and stopped including me—love it! I keep a\nshort, compact “to-do” list and anything time-bound is in my calendar. These get my attention before\nany other “inbox” does because I’ve previously decided what’s important for me to get done—the rest\ncan wait.\nI could go on, but all in all I think this is a message that the self-employed need to hear so badly. With\nno “boss” and no “clean edges” to work-life/home-life it’s so easy to fall into a W4W grind and your\nbusiness becomes a tractor beam that trails you inexorably down that path. 4HWW is the antidote!” —\nANDREW, self-employed in the UK\nSTAR WARS , ANYONE?\nI knew my quest for the 4-Hour Workweek was working when my daughter’s kindergarten teacher\nasked her the question: “What kind of work does your father do?” As the teacher re-told the story back\nto me, it was my daughter’s answer that really struck a chord. “Your daughter turned and looked up at\nme with the most serious look on her face and said, ‘My dad just sits around and watches Star Wars all\nday.’”\nIt’s funny how this one simple question, and not to mention my daughter’s answer, would be the\nmoment of true 4HWW self-awareness for me. You see the answer my daughter gave her teacher has a\ndeeper meaning. I believe what she meant to say, if she could articulate it, was “My dad sort of does\nwhatever he wants to do.”\nI read the 4HWW almost two years ago when I was on vacation at the beach with my family. I\nremember it well, because I kept reading parts of the book to my wife, bothering her to no end. I am a\ndeveloper and enterprise administrator for a large financial institution in Atlanta, Georgia. Part of my job\nis supporting the large complex document captures systems that I help build. Due to the importance of\nthese systems I am expected to be reachable 24/7/365. That is good for job security, but can be bad for\nmy family life. I have four beautiful children and I strive to be a true “hands-on” dad who is present in\nmy family’s daily lives. So armed with your book and a fresh (ocean air) perspective, I set out to put\nmany of the 4HWW principles into practice.\nFirst, I worked on changing my e-mail habits. I took a hard look at my inbox and used several of the\ntechniques outlined in the 4HWW to eliminate all the waste and noise. I formed new habits around\nbatching my e-mail sessions and it didn’t take long to achieve a zero inbox using the “trusted trio” folder\nmethod. I also applied the less is more philosophy to composing my e-mails. I went to great lengths to\nensure I am as clear and concise as possible. Only communicating exactly what is needed to the right\naudience and not to the world. By eliminating all the noise and fat from my e-mail diet it became much\nmore clear what “actions” or “to-do’s” were important.\nMeetings and conference calls were the next area of attack. I scrutinized each meeting invite and\nbegan declining requests left and right. Most of the time I would claim I had too much going on to\nattend. I started asking for the minutes of the meeting or for someone to IM me if they had a specific\nquestion I needed to answer. When I do attend a meeting it is almost always via a conference call. Due\nto conference room restrictions and geographic challenges in our company most of our meetings are\ndone virtually anyway.\nLess wasted time meant more time to focus on work and tasks that really mattered. I felt like I was\ndoing less but getting more things done and with better results. The right people were starting to notice\nand the perception of my ability to get the job done had never been better. I was making my management\nlook good, and when that happens they stop asking questions or micromanaging daily activities. I kept\nproving to them I can do it without interference. Now was the time to make the push for what I really\nwanted and that was to go virtual!\nGoing virtual was actually very easy. I had a solid foundation with my manager and others in the\nchain of command. Almost all of my daily work was already remote-ready. At home, I have a great\ndedicated office in our finished basement. It is situated well away from the rest of the house and is\nmostly free of distractions. I have my own bathroom with shower and I even have a mini-fridge and\nmicrowave. I dare say that my home office rivals the amenities of the top executives at my company.\nMost of all, I have a wife and family that totally understand and respect the rules I set for myself to\ncontinue this success.\nAt first, I worked one or two days a week from home, but it didn’t take long before I found myself\nworking four out of five days a week from home. When the Southeast was hit by the gas shortage and\nthe price of gas nationwide was cresting $4 a gallon, the company made working from home even more\naccepted and official. I became an overnight model for others to follow. As people around me were in a\npanic as to how to get to work when no gas could be found, I was happily working away at home just\nbusiness as usual.\nAt this point, things were working better than I ever expected. Using my 4HWW skills I now had\nmore time to be that hands-on dad I wanted to be. I became a regular up at the elementary school. I eat\nlunch in the cafeteria with my girls, especially on fried chicken day! I participate in a program called\nD.E.A.R. which stands for Drop Everything and Read, where a few times a month I come in and read to\neach class. I drive my kids to school and I get to see them when they come home. For my entire family, I\nam present in their everyday lives, and can’t put a price on that. I felt like I had achieved my goal. That\nwas that. So I thought…\nOther things started to happen. Without conscientiously knowing it, people around me at the school or\nchurch had a weird respect for me. I say weird because people literally mistook me as a doctor or just\nsome sort of self-made millionaire. I am not kidding. There is this one guy who still calls me “Doc.” I\nguess the reason for this is because most people still cling to the old stereotypes of what they think it is\nto be “rich.” I always seem to show up for the school functions or just special days at the school, usually\nin casual attire and never obsessing over time or my Blackberry. Now I have people nominating me for\nthings like committee chair on the PTA, and just recently I was elected to the board of directors at our\nlocal swim/ tennis club. The cool thing is, I actually have the time to do those things and still be\neffective at work and at home. It goes without saying that new doors are open to me now. More than ever\nbefore.\nWith all of this going on around me I still come back to what my daughter said to her teacher. In truth,\nI am at a point where if I wanted to “sit around and watch Star Wars all day,” I certainly could. But, I\nfind myself filling the extra time now doing things that really mean something. Being present in the\neveryday lives of my family, helping my community, or volunteering at my church. Now I have a plan to\ntake it to the next level and write my own book. The project I am working on is called The Virtual\nEmployee Handbook. It is a collection of tips and how-to’s on all the tools that are essential to the\nmodern virtual employee, like me. We will see how that goes. One thing I do know is that I wouldn’t\neven dream of what I am doing now if it wasn’t for The 4-Hour Workweek! —W. HIGGINS\n91. Maya Frost, The New Global Student (Crown, 2009).\n92. A simple, actual proposal is provided.\nRESTRICTED READING\nThe Few That Matter\nA hypocrite is a person who—but who isn’t?\n—DON MARQUIS\nI know, I know. I said not to read too much. Hence, the recommendations here are restricted to the\nbest of the best this book’s interviewees and I have used and named when asked, “What is the one book\nthat changed your life the most?”\nNone of them are required to do what we’ve talked about in this book. That said, consider them if you\nget stuck on a particular point. The page counts are listed, and if you practice the exercises in “How to\nRead 200% Faster in 10 Minutes” in Chapter 6, you should be able to read at least 2.5 pages per minute\n(100 pages thus equals 40 minutes).\nFor additional categories, including practical philosophy, licensing, and language learning, be sure to\nvisit our comprehensive companion site.\nThe Fundamental Four: Let Me Explain\nThe Fundamental Four are so named because they are the four books I recommended to aspiring\nlifestyle designers prior to writing The 4-Hour Workweek. Still well worth reading, here is the sequence I\nsuggest:\nThe Magic of Thinking Big (192 pages)\nBY DAVID SCHWARTZ\nThis book was first recommended to me by Stephen Key, an ultrasuccessful inventor who has made\nmillions licensing products to companies, including Disney, Nestlé, and Coca-Cola. It is the favorite\nbook of many superperformers worldwide, ranging from legendary football coaches to famous CEOs,\nand has more than 100 5-star ratings on Amazon. The main message is don’t overestimate others and\nunderestimate yourself. I still read the first two chapters of this book whenever doubt creeps in.\nHow to Make Millions with Your Ideas:\nAn Entrepreneur’s Guide (272 pages)\nBY DAN S. KENNEDY\nThis is a menu of options for converting ideas into millions. I read this when I was in high school and\nhave read it five times since. It is like steroids for your entrepreneurship cortex. The case studies, from\nDomino’s Pizza to casinos and mail-order products, are outstanding, even if outdated in a few instances.\nThe E-Myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don’t Work and What to Do About It (288 pages)\nBY MICHAEL E. GERBER\nGerber is a masterful storyteller and his classic of automation discusses how to use a franchise mind-set\nto create scalable businesses that are based on rules and not outstanding employees. It is an excellent\nroad map—told in parable—for becoming an owner instead of constant micromanager. If you’re stuck in\nyour own business, this book will get you unstuck in no time.\nVagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel (224 pages)\nBY ROLF POTTS\nRolf is the man. This is the book that got me to stop making excuses and pack for an extended hiatus. It\ncovers bits of everything but is particularly helpful for determining your destination, adjusting to life on\nthe road, and re-assimilating back into ordinary life. It includes great little excerpts from famous\nvagabonds, philosophers, and explorers, as well as anecdotes from ordinary travelers. This is the first of\ntwo books (the other was Walden, below) that I took with me on my first 15-month mini-retirement.\nWalden (384 pages)\nReducing Emotional and Material Baggage\nBY HENRY DAVID THOREAU\nThis is considered by many to be the masterpiece of reflective simple living. Thoreau lived on the edge\nof a small lake in rural Massachusetts for two years, building his own shelter and living alone, as an\nexperiment in self-reliance and minimalism. It was both a huge success and a failure, which is what\nmakes this book such a compelling read.\nLess Is More: The Art of Voluntary Poverty—An Anthology of Ancient and Modern Voices in Praise\nof Simplicity (336 pages)\nEDITED BY GOLDIAN VANDENBROECK\nThis is a collection of bite-sized philosophies on simple living. I read it to learn how to do the most with\nthe least and eliminate artificial needs, not live like a monk—big difference. It incorporates actionable\nprinciples and short stories ranging from Socrates to Benjamin Franklin and the Bhagavad Gita to\nmodern economists.\nThe Monk and the Riddle: The Education of a Silicon Valley Entrepreneur (192 pages)\nBY RANDY KOMISAR\nThis great book was given to me by Professor Zschau as a graduation gift and introduced me to the\nphrase “deferred-life plan.” Randy, a virtual CEO and partner at the legendary Kleiner Perkins, has been\ndescribed as a “combined professional mentor, minister without portfolio, in-your-face investor, troubleshooter\nand door opener.” Let a true Silicon Valley wizard show you how he created his ideal life using\nrazor-sharp thinking and Buddhist-like philosophies. I’ve met him—he’s the real deal.\nThe 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Success by Achieving More with Less (288 pages)\nBY RICHARD KOCH\nThis book explores the “nonlinear” world, discusses the mathematical and historical support for the 80/20\nPrinciple, and offers practical applications of the same.\nMuse Creation and Related Skills\nHarvard Business School Case Studies www.hbsp.harvard.edu (click on “school cases”)\nOne of the secrets behind Harvard Business School’s teaching success is the case method—using real-life\ncase studies for discussion. These cases take you inside the marketing and operational plans of 24-Hour\nFitness, Southwest Airlines, Timberland, and hundreds of other companies. Few people realize that you\ncan purchase these case studies for less than $10 apiece instead of spending more than $100,000 to go to\nHarvard (not that the latter isn’t worth it). There is a case study for every situation, problem, and\nbusiness model.\n“This business has legs”: How I Used Infomercial Marketing to Create the $100,000,000 Thighmaster\nCraze: An Entrepreneurial Adventure Story (206 pages)\nBY PETER BIELER\nThis is the story of how a naïve (in the best sense of the word) Peter Bieler started from scratch—no\nproduct, no experience, no cash—and created a $100-million merchandising empire in less than two\nyears. It is a mind-expanding and often hysterical case study that uses real numbers to discuss the fine\npoints of everything from dealing with celebrities to marketing, production, legal, and retail. Peter can\nnow finance the media purchases for your product: www.mediafunding.com.\nSecrets of Power Negotiating: Inside Secrets from a Master Negotiator (256 pages)\nBY ROGER DAWSON\nThis is the one negotiating book that really opened my eyes and gave me practical tools I could use\nimmediately. I used the audio adaptation. If you’re hungry for more, William Ury’s Getting Past No and\nG. Richard Shell’s Bargaining for Advantage: Negotiation Strategies for Reasonable People are\noutstanding.
