I appreciate your having informed us that you \nalready have our May 19 and May 27 communications to the Deputy Attorney General, as well \nas our prior written submissions to CEOS and to the Southern District of Florida. \nIn light of the significant volume of our prior submissions and to facilitate your review, \nwe have drafted four supplemental submissions that will provide a roadmap for your \ninvestigation of this matter. Given the bulk of these documents and their appended supporting \nattachments, you will receive this packet by messenger tomorrow. A brief description of each of \nthe four submissions follows. First, I have included a succinct summary of the facts, law and \npolicy issues at hand. This document sets forth a basic overview of the issues and summarizes \nour principal contentions as to why federal prosecution of this matter is neither appropriate nor \nwarranted. \nThe three other submissions include: a summary of the irregularities and misconduct that \noccurred during the federal investigation; a letter from former CEOS attorney Stephanie Thacker \nthat responds to CEOS 's assessment of its limited review of Mr. Epstein's case; and a point-by-\npoint rebuttal to First Assistant United States Attorney Jeffrey Sloman's recent letter which we \nbelieve contains factual inaccuracies typical of our correspondence from the United States \nAttorney's Office in Miami (the \"USAO\"). Also, for your reference, the package you receive \ntomorrow will contain a binder including all documentation to which we refer in our \nsubmissions. Finally, we will be providing a detailed checklist of each submission or substantive \ncommunication to the USAO. Our intention is that you have copies of each such document to \nenhance your review. If there are any that you have not received from the USAO or CEOS, \nplease advise and we will fedex them to you without delay. \nHong Kong London Munich New York San Francisco Washington, D.C. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012130 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nJohn Roth, Esq. \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 2 \nAs you are likely aware, the Department's prior review of this matter was incomplete \nand, by its own admission, not \"de novo.\" See Tab 38, May 15, 2008 Letter from A. Oosterbaan. \nWithout considering the Non Prosecution Agreement that left this matter to be resolved in the \nState or any of the misconduct, CEOS reviewers, tasked with reviewing some of their own \npreviously expressed opinions, assessed only whether the United States Attorney would \"abuse \n[his] discretion\" if he pursued this case. While we appreciate CEOS' s willingness to examine \nthese limited issues, its conclusion that a prosecution would not be an \"abuse of discretion\" rings \nparticularly hollow in light of CEOS 's admirably candid concessions that we have raised \n\"compelling\" objections and that a prosecution on these facts would require \"novel\" applications \nof federal law. Indeed, even a brief review of CEOS's own mission statement reveals how \ninapposite a federal prosecution is to the facts in this case. \nImportantly, we note that the CEOS review was conducted prior to the Supreme Court's \nvery recent decisions in Santos and Cuellar, which we believe—illuminating as they do the \nCourt's interpretive methodology when it comes to federal criminal law—powerfully \ndemonstrate the substantive vulnerability of the USAO's unprecedented employment of three \nfederal laws. That Office's interpretation would never pass muster under the Supreme Court's \nrecent pronouncements and should not be countenanced. That is all the more true under the \ncircumstances where the duly appointed U.S. Attorney opined that, in effect, the \"unitary\" \nExecutive Branch was driving this prosecution. We now know that is not so. \nWhat I respectfully request, and what I hope you will provide, is a truly \"de novo\" \nreview—that is, an independent assessment of whether federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein is both \nnecessary and warranted in view of the legal and evidentiary hurdles that have been identified, \nthe existence of a State felony plea and sentence that have been advocated by the State Attorney \nfor Palm Beach County, and the many issues of prosecutorial misconduct and overzealousness \nthat have permeated the investigation. I also request that you provide us with the opportunity \nduring your review to meet with you in person to answer any questions you may have and to \nelucidate some of the issues in our submission. \nWe believe that an independent review will confirm our strong belief that federal \nprosecutors would be required to stretch the plain meaning of each element of the enumerated \nstatutes, and then to combine these distorted elements in a tenuous chain, in order to convict Mr. \nEpstein. Indeed, just this week (and after two years of federal involvement in this matter), \nAssistant United States Attorney Villafana re-initiated the federal grand jury investigation—in \ndirect contravention of the parties' Non Prosecution Agreement—and issued yet another \nsubpoena seeking evidence in this case. See Tab 19, Subpoena to In the \nsubpoena, AUSA Villafana directs_____________________to appear on July 1, 2008 to give testimony \nand produce documents to FGJ 07-103 West Palm Beach. The attachment to the subpoena seeks \ndocuments such as photographs, emails, telephone billing information, and contact information \nthat relate to Mr. Epstein as well as specific other people who received protection from federal \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012131 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nJohn Roth, Esq. \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 3 \nprosecution as a result of Mr. Epstein's having entered into the September 24, 2007 Non \nProsecution Agreement with the USAO. \nNotably, the Non Prosecution Agreement contains the following agreed condition: \nFurther, upon execution of this agreement and a plea agreement with the State Attorney's Office, \nthe federal Grand Jury investigation will be suspended, and all pending federal Grand Jury \nsubpoenas will be held in abeyance unless and until the defendant violates any term of this \nagreement. The defendant likewise agrees to withdraw his pending motion to intervene and to \nquash certain grand jury subpoenas. \nSee Tab 21, September 24, 2007 Non Prosecution Agreement. It also guarantees that persons \nidentified in the Grand Jury subpoena such as_________________________________and Leslie Groff \nand others will not be prosecuted. The new Grand Jury subpoena clearly violates the Non-\nProsecution Agreement. Although Mr. Epstein has exercised his rights to appeal to the \nDepartment of Justice with the full consent and knowledge of the USAO, he has not breached the \nAgreement. The re-commencing of the Grand Jury is in violation of the Agreement. \nBut further, the new investigation, which features a wide-ranging, fishing-expedition type \nto search in New York does nothing to satisfy the very essential elements of federal statutes that \nare lacking despite the intensity of an over two-year investigation in the Palm Beach area. \nAbsent evidence of Internet luring, inducements while using the phone, travel for the purpose, \nfraud or coercion, the subject of the New York investigation is as lacking in the essential basis \nfor converting a state case into a federal case as is the remainder of the Florida investigation. \nThe reaching out to New York to fill the void emanating from the failures of the Florida \ninvestigation compellingly demonstrates the misuse of federal resources in an overzealous, over-\npersonalized, selective and extraordinary attempt to expand federal law to where it is has never \ngone. This last-ditch attempt by Ms. Villafana reinforces our belief that the USA() does not have \nfacts that, without distortion, would justify a prosecution of Mr. Epstein. \nIn view of the prosecution's often-verbalized desire to punish Mr. Epstein, we believe \nthat the prosecution summary suffers from critical inaccuracies and aggregates the expected \ntestimony of witnesses so as to reach a conclusion of guilt. Our contention is reinforced by the \nfact that key prosecution witnesses have provided evidence and testimony that directly \nundermines the prosecution's misleading and inaccurate summary of its case. Indeed, we now \nhave received statements from three of the principal accusers— _  (through a state \ncriminal deposition), (through a federal FBI-USAO sworn and transcribed \ninterview), and (through a defense—generated sworn transcribed interview). \nEach of these witnesses categorically denies each essential element that the prosecution will have \nto prove in order to convert this quintessential state-law case into a federal matter. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012132 \nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP \nJohn Roth, Esq. \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 4 \nIt thus is especially troubling that the USAO has not provided us with the transcript of \n's federal interview, nor the substance of the interviews with Ms. or Ms. \n, nor any information generated by interviews with any of the approximately 40 alleged \nwitnesses that the prosecution claims it has identified. Because the information provided by \nthese women goes directly to the question of Mr. Epstein's guilt or innocence, it is classic Brady \ninformation. We understand that the U.S. Attorney might not want to disclose impeachment \ninformation about their witnesses prior to a charge or during plea negotiations. But we firmly \nbelieve that when the Government possesses information that goes directly to a target's factual \nguilt or innocence, the target should be informed about such heartland exculpatory evidence. \nMost importantly, aside from whether the Department believes Brady obligates \ndisclosure to a target of a federal investigation prior to the target's formal accusation, no such \nlimit should apply to a Department review. Accordingly, we request that you go beneath the face \nof any summary provided to you by the USAO and instead review the actual witness transcripts \nand FBI 302s, which are essential for you to be able to make a truly independent assessment of \nthe strength and wisdom of any federal prosecution. \nAfter careful consideration of the record, and as much as it pains me to say this, I simply \ndo not believe federal prosecutors would have been involved at all in this matter if not for Mr. \nEpstein's personal wealth and publicly-reported ties to former President Bill Clinton. A simple \nInternet search on Mr. Epstein reveals myriad articles and news stories about the former \nPresident's personal relationship with Mr. Epstein, including multi-page stories in New York \nMagazine and Vanity Fair. Mr. Epstein, in fact, only came to the public's attention a few years \nago when he and the former President traveled for a week to Africa (using Mr. Epstein's \nairplane)—a trip that received a great deal of press coverage. I cannot imagine that the USA() \never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case if Mr. Epstein lacked this type of \nnotoriety. \nThat belief has been reinforced by the significant prosecutorial impropriety and \nmisconduct throughout the course of this matter. While we describe the majority of these \nirregularities in another submission, two instances are particularly troubling. First, the USA() \nauthorized the public disclosure of specific details of the open investigation to the New York \nTimes—including descriptions of the prosecution's theory of the case and specific terms of a plea \nnegotiation between the parties. Second, AUSA Villafana attempted to enrich friends and close \nacquaintances by bringing them business in connection with this matter. Specifically, she \nattempted to appoint a close personal friend of her live-in boyfriend to serve as an attorney-\nrepresentative for the women involved in this case. \nIt also bears mentioning that actions taken by FAUSA Sloman present an appearance of \nimpropriety that gives us cause for concern. Mr. Sloman's former law partner is currently \npursuing a handful of $50-million lawsuits against Mr. Epstein by some of the masseuses. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012133 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nJohn Roth, Esq. \nJune 19, 2008 \nPage 5 \nFinally, as you know, Mr. Epstein and the USA() entered into an agreement that deferred \nprosecution to the State. In this regard, I simply note that the manner in which this agreement \nwas negotiated contrasts sharply with Mr. Sloman's current representation that \"[Vile SDFL \nindicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of incarceration . . . \" See Tab 1, May 19, \n2008 Letter from J. Sloman, p. 2. This statement is simply not true. Contrary to Mr. Sloman's \nassertion, federal prosecutors refused to accept what the State believed to be appropriate as to \nMr. Epstein's sentence and instead, insisted that Mr. Epstein be required serve a two-year term of \nimprisonment (which they later decreased to 18 months plus one year of house arrest). Federal \nprosecutors have not only involved themselves in what is quintessentially a state matter, but their \nactions have caused a critical appearance of impropriety that raises doubt as to their motivation \nfor investigating and prosecuting Mr. Epstein in the first place. \nAt bottom, we appreciate your willingness to review this matter with a fresh—and \nindependent—set of eyes. To facilitate your review, I once again request the opportunity to \nmake an oral presentation to supplement our written submissions, and we will promptly respond \nto any inquiries you may have. \nKenneth W. Starr \ncc: Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012134 ",

Contrary to Mr. Sloman's \nassertion, federal prosecutors refused to accept what the State believed to be appropriate as to \nMr. Epstein's sentence and instead, insisted that Mr. Epstein be required serve a two-year term of \nimprisonment (which they later decreased to 18 months plus one year of house arrest). Federal \nprosecutors have not only involved themselves in what is quintessentially a state matter, but their \nactions have caused a critical appearance of impropriety that raises doubt as to their motivation \nfor investigating and prosecuting Mr. Epstein in the first place.
