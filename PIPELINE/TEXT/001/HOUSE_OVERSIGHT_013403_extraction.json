City Spy hears that business-to-business\npublisher United Business Media is the latest outfit which is thinking of ramping up its subscription\nmodel. Property Week and Building are among the titles which recently started asking users to register their details to\nkeep reading stories, which is seen as a possible precursor to charging.\nBUSINESSES TIPPED TO COME A CROPPER\nAMID all the contradictory forecasts for recovery or double-dip recession in 2010, what do the insolvency practitioners\nsay? City Spy's mole in the bean-counting world says the last quarter of 2009 was surprisingly quiet as the\neconomy stabilised but they are not optimistic about the new year: \"We reckon there's going to be a rush of insolvencies\nin the second quarter, after the end of the financial year.\" The next quarterly rent review is due tomorrow, Christmas\nDay, then again at the end of March. But given the number of \"seasonal sales\" that started on the High Street at least a\nweek before Christmas, it would be no surprise to see some retailers come a cropper sooner...\nEPSTEIN PILOT TAKES TO THE ROAD\nFURTHER news reaches City Spy of former Bear Stearns trader, Prince Andrew's shooting companion and convicted\nsex offender, Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe ex-Wall Street star served 13 months in jail on criminal charges of soliciting prostitution and procuring a minor\nfor prostitution and he now faces civil claims from young women accusing him of having unlawful sex with them. This\nweek, City Spy recounted how Epstein had transferred the title deeds of his prized 2003 Ferrari 575M Maranello to his\nprivate pilot Larry Visoki, prior to the car going on sale for $159,000 (£99,000) (possibly to help Epstein pay his legal\nbills). It turns out, the same Visoki was deposed last week by Bradley Edwards, an attorney for three of the women suing\nEpstein. Questioned by Edwards about plane passengers who might have witnessed Epstein in the company of\nyoung girls, Visoki admitted Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak, former Colombian\npresident Andrés Pastrana Arango, Obama economic adviser Lawrence Summers, billionaire Ron Burkle, and actors\nKevin Spacey and Chris Tucker had been on board the plane while young girls were present. Fortuitously for Epstein,\nhowever, Ferrari-selling Visoki swore on oath that he never suspected his boss of having sex with them.\nOf course not, Larry. Now drive off into the sunset.\nMore on Prince Andrew, our special representative for international trade and investment. The European Parliament\nand the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe have strongly condemned Azerbaijan for tightening restrictions\non the media and jailing two bloggers who were critical of the government. It transpires the oil-rich country\nhas long blocked BBC broadcasts there, which might explain why oft-criticised Andrew and former Prime Minister\nTony Blair spend so much time visiting the sometime Soviet State.\nWhat does the snow have in common with the recession? Every other country can get out of both but Britain can't\nget out of either. HAPPY news: private jet travel is back, reports the Wall Street Journal. Alas, there is a \"but\" [#x2039]\nCITY SPY The Evening Standard (London) December 24, 2009 Thursday\nPage 2\nin-flight food remains in recession. Apparently, those who supply food to executive aircraft are seeing demand soar\nafter a slump, but says one caterer: \"No one is eating lobster. A quick turkey box lunch is the order of the day.\" Of\ncourse, that has nothing to do with the industry being desperate to re-brand itself as time-saving and cost-efficient.\nWHICH insurance broker saw a compliance officer pass out after the office Christmas lunch and have to be taken\nto hospital?\nWHO MADE OFF WITH THE MONEY? IT's a year since the Bernie Madoff affair blew up and the hedge fund\nking was found to have been ripping off his clients. If he was in Britain the old fraudster would still be at liberty as\nlawyers pored over his case and the prosecution had barely cranked into operation. But the US is different [#x2039] his\ncase is done and dusted, and he's languishing in jail. Even so, by US standards, the Madoff conviction was going some.\nRumours persist that he pleaded guilty as quickly as he did and said the absolute minimum because he wasn't the main\ncrook of the piece [#x2039] the main business of his hedge fund was washing money for organised crime.
