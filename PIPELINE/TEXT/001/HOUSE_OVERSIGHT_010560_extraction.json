Therefore, will be able to sue \nMr. Epstein for the sexual abuse which she experienced while she was a minor. \nwas the perfect victim. \nShe was born in M, a town on the coast. When was four years \nold, descended into civil war. At the age of six, her entire village was evacuated. She \nfled her hometown travelling through war zones on foot with her family, in a stream of refugees. \nHer family settled in the outskirts of . As refugees, with no money, her family \nlived together in one room, sharing a bathroom with other families. Her parents eventually \nfound low paying, unskilled jobs.

She was a huge success and began modeling at age fourteen. Though her \nparents disparaged her for marketing her appearance, they allowed her to work because she \nearned more than their combined income. \nAt age sixteen, moved to New York City to model. She lived in an \napartment for models, with one or two roommates and no adult on the premises. Her father was \ndeeply ashamed of her because he disapproved of her profession and her parents distanced \nthemselves. \ndays were hectic with professional assignments. She worked with top tier \nclients and for DNA Modeling Agency, a well-known agency representing supermodels such as \nLinda Evangelista and Natalia Vodianova. \nwas very innocent and inexperienced prior to meeting Mr. Epstein. At age \nsixteen, experienced her first kiss. The director of a perfume campaign, Fabian \nBarron, wanted a kiss at the end of the commercial as a finale to a perfume ad. She dreaded her \nparents' reaction to seeing the commercial. She was raised in the Orthodox Christian Church \nwhere abstinence was encouraged. \nmet Jeffrey Epstein when was sixteen years old. She was introduced \nthrough a fellow model a few years her senior. \nMr. Epstein seemed bigger than life. He did not drink or do drugs, which put her at ease. \nHe was friends with former President Bill Clinton, the President who made it possible for ME \nand her family to immigrate to America. When she told Mr. Epstein how her family \ncame to America, Mr. Epstein said he would personally thank \"Bill\" for her. Mr. Epstein touted \nother impressive connections. He made it known that he had A list celebrities on speed-dial. \nShe felt very fortunate to have made the connection with Mr. Epstein. \nAs s estrangement from her family increased, Mr. Epstein's role in her life \nbecame more and more important. He encouraged her and built her confidence. She trusted him \ncompletely. \nMr. Epstein told hat he was on the board of directors at Harvard \nUniversity. He promised that once she took her SATs and obtained the scores she needed, he \nwould write a letter of recommendation for her, which he said would carry significant weight \nwith regard to her admission. Her dream was to establish herself as a successful model and to \none day graduate from Harvard. Mr. Epstein made her feel that everything she wanted was \npossible. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 010561 \nScott Link \nJune 19, 2019 \nPage 3 \nconfided to him that she had never even had a boyfriend. He told her \neverything would fall into place, \"just keep doing what you are doing, work hard and stay \nfocused.\" She told Mr. Epstein that she preferred to abstain from sex until she was married. \nThe first time asked her for a massage was to help with an ache in his \nshoulder. thought it was an innocent request. He said his masseuse had failed to \nget a kink out of his shoulder. He gave her a large purple massager for her to use to take the knot \nout of his back. Mr. Epstein told her she was an excellent masseuse and she was pleased to be \nable to ease his pain. \nWhen the massage ended, Mr. Epstein pulled two hundred dollars from his wallet and \nhanded it to her. He said, \"I was going to give it to the masseuse anyway, so you take it and pay \nfor your car service or something.\" \nMr. Epstein began calling her every day, no matter where she was in the world. He told \nher he loved her. He became a vital part of_________________Iworld as her parents remained \ndistant. He invited her to stay at one of his apartments close to him on the Upper East Side. Her \narduous work schedule, starting with 6:00 a.m. call times and shows running late into the night \nwere exhausting. Epstein's daily check-up calls and pep talks gave her strength to survive her \ngrinding schedule. \nWhen in Paris, Mr. Epstein allowed her to stay at his home with her sister and arranged \nfor a night out at a concert with Naomi Campbell. It appeared to that Mr. Epstein's \nthoughts were focused on her career, future and good fortune. \nThe first time the purple massage tool found its way between her legs, told \nhim to stop, but Mr. Epstein pushed the head of the massager firmly against her and forced her \nlegs apart. She felt ashamed and embarrassed. The massages became a ritual and were always \naccompanied with sexual abuse and a two-hundred dollar payment at the end. \nMr. Epstein approached her as if he was her mentor and teacher, teaching her about \nsexuality, opening her eyes. She experienced immense orgasms, and then shame and fear. She \nfelt claustrophobia as she stared up into Mr. Epstein's church-like ceiling of the massage parlor \nwhile he fondled her. She felt she couldn't escape her position, and that this was the way it had \nto be because this powerful man orchestrated it. At the end of each massage he would make \nhimself ejaculate by demanding she pay vigorous attention to his nipples with her fingers and he \nwould tell her what a good girl she was, that he loved her and would call her later, which made \neverything seem better. Then he would open his wallet filled with hundred dollar bills and give \nher a couple, which she accepted as pocket money, never thinking twice about it. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 010562 \nScott Link \nJune 19, 2019 \nPage 4 \nthought this is what it must feel like to become a woman. She was both \nthrilled and ashamed. She followed the path that Mr. Epstein set out for her because he said if \nshe trusted him and did what he told her to do, everything would go according to his plan and her \ncareer would soar. Without him the world was a scary and unpredictable place. When she was \nwith him, she felt like everything was right because of how much love and care she received \nfrom him. She started to think and believe that they would be together and that he would marry \nher. \nHe used the purple massage vibrator on her time and time again. She closed her eyes \nfeeling lost, overwhelmed and out of control. \nWhen he stuck his penis in her mouth, she did what she was told. She choked and \ngagged and when she tried to move her head away he forced it back into place. Mr. Epstein was \nextremely aggressive. When it was over he told her how amazing she was. She continued to \nbelieve in Mr. Epstein's friendship and guidance. \nMr. Epstein took her virginity. This was the trajectory for which he groomed her. = \nfirst sexual experience was devoid of tenderness or affection. She was stripped down \nand made to shower. Mr. Epstein told her, \"If you're lying about being a virgin, or I get a \ndisease from you, I'll kill you.\" She felt her mind separate from her body during intercourse. \nShe began to feel like a shell of her former self. She was mortified and in agony. She \nfelt she had become everything her parents feared she would become. She was appearing in \nbeauty magazines and making hundreds of thousands of dollars, but felt dirty and worthless. Mr. \nEpstein made her feel like nothing more than a teenage prostitute. Everything came crashing \ndown once she realized that this was not love. \nleft Mr. Epstein's residence for the last time feeling less than human. On \nher way out, she passed a young girl who appeared to be another young model. As \nturned around to glance back, she saw the young woman entering Mr. Epstein's residence. She \nwas disgusted with the realization that she was one of many called to \"massage\" Epstein. \nhad a nervous breakdown while alone in New York. She found herself \ncrying inconsolably, shaking, hyperventilating and unable to go to her castings and meetings. \nShe was suicidal. She feared confiding in her agents and reaching out for help from them \nbecause she was so ashamed. She booked a ticket to go home. \nShe flew back to Kansas where her parents were living. She never returned to New York. \nwas devastated with the realization of what she was lured into and how she \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 010563 \nScott Link \nJune 19, 2019 \nPage 5 \nhad been victimized. It shattered her to her core. At the vulnerable age of 16, Mr. Epstein made \nhimself the center of her existence and the master of her world. She realized she was a \ndisposable pawn in his game. She could not talk about her years with Mr. Epstein because she \nwas consumed with shame. At 16 years old, he isolated her and made himself her only \nemotional support system. Her mental torment and pain turned into depression. She was \nprescribed medication. She numbed herself and tried not to deal with what had happened. She \ntried to block the pain. \n____________was embarrassed that she had been used and abused. She withdrew and had \nno desire to model or interact with anyone in the modeling world anymore. \nstopped taking calls from modeling agencies, and eventually they stopped calling for good. She \nwas afraid to go to New York where her emotions and memories would be triggered. \nThe final contact between and Mr. Epstein was when he tracked her \nparent's house phone number in Kansas and tried to speak to her. mother \ngrabbed the phone and told Mr. Epstein she was calling the police before hanging up on him. \nHer career dwindled to nothing. Taking a break from the modeling industry when clients \nlike Italian Vogue and Victoria's Secret were requesting bookings constituted career suicide. \nIn Kansas she became chronically depressed. She was suicidal before her 18th birthday. \nShe called the suicide hotline many times from her home. \nWhile in Kansas, a friend of________________ent her an email with news that Mr. Epstein \nhad been arrested for trafficking underaged girls. felt as if she had gone from \nbeing a supermodel to becoming an unsuspecting prostitute. Her parents' warnings of what \nwould become of her in New York had come to fruition. She fell prey to a child predator, Mr. \nEpstein, and it took her a decade to understand the gravity of what Epstein had done to her as a \nvulnerable young girl. \nMr. Epstein mas ueraded as a loving mentor, a parental substitute and friend who had \nnothing bul best interest in mind. The repercussions of the sexual and mental \nabuseendured remain with her. Her first sexual encounters are forever scarred by \nmemories of Mr. Epstein forcing his purple massage device between her legs amidst her cries for \nhim to stop. Debilitating nausea and stomach pain followed her separation from him. She had \nno framework with which to reference what a \"normal\" sexual experience was. She remains \nplagued with self-doubt and insecurity and finds it nearly impossible to separate memories of \nMr. Epstein's manipulation and abuse from new relationships she tries to develop. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 010564 \nScott Link \nJune 19, 2019 \nPage 6 \nThe sexual abuse Mr. Epstein inflicted upon left irreparable psychological \nscars. She has struggled and continues to struggle with her ability to maintain healthy \nrelationships with men and in general. Her career is permanently compromised and the \nlikelihood of recovering severed professional ties is non-existent. \nPlease contact us within ten days of this letter to advise whether Mr. Epstein is amenable \nto attempting to resolve 's civil claims without litigation. \nVery truly yours, \nALLRED, MAROKO & GOLDBERG \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 010565 \n"
