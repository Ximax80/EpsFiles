I mentioned that -- that there\n02:16:17  15  had been three efforts to get information from\n02:16:18  16  Mr. Dershowitz by way of a 2009 deposition request, a\n02:16:23  17  2011 deposition request, and further follow-up\n02:16:26  18  correspondence from counsel on that, and a 2013 document\n02:16:31  19  request all propounded to Mr. Dershowitz that had not\n02:16:34  20  gone answered.\n02:16:35  21           Yeah, and this was -- yeah, I'm sorry, this\n02:16:37  22  slipped my mind at the time -- but when -- when we saw\n02:16:40  23  Mr. Dershowitz not responding to these answers, you\n02:16:44  24  know, maybe the mail didn't get delivered to him or\n02:16:46  25  something like that. I don't -- I suppose that's, you\n\n111\n02:18:00   1  strategy to sort of stall the investigation to say:\n02:18:03   2           Well, we will get you Epstein; oh, we can't meet now;\n02:18:03   3  oh, we will get it now -- and then -- and so forth.\n02:18:04   4           And so one of the things that I noted from all\n02:18:06   5  that was that Mr. Dershowitz, as Mr. Epstein's attorney,\n02:18:09   6  never ultimately produced Epstein for a meeting with the\n02:18:14   7  Palm Beach Police Department, having made another offer.\n02:18:17   8           Now, obviously, something could have happened\n02:18:19   9  there. I mean, I don't -- you know, I don't know what\n02:18:21  10  was the communications and so forth, but as an attorney\n02:18:24  11  trying to get information and unable to do that, I had\n02:18:26  12  to make some reasonable inferences.\n02:18:29  13           And so one of the inferences I began to draw\n02:18:31  14  was that this was a stall tactic by Mr. Dershowitz, and\n02:18:34  15  in my view, potentially, an unethical one, but I\n02:18:37  16  don't -- I don't think we need to get into that in this\n02:18:39  17  litigation.\n02:18:40  18           What I saw was a stall tactic going on,\n02:18:44  19  and -- and the reason I think it was a stall tactic, as\n02:18:46  20  we are sitting here now in, what is it, October of 2015,\n02:18:51  21  and Mr. Epstein has never been willing to answer\n02:18:54  22  questions about his sexual abuse of these girls.\n02:18:58  23           And this was back in around -- what was it?\n02:19:01  24  I guess it would be 2005, 2006, you know, roughly a\n02:19:04  25  decade ago, Mr. Dershowitz was offering to make Epstein\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n110\n02:16:48   1  know, a theoretical possibility.\n02:16:50   2           But -- but the reason I ruled out that\n02:16:52   3  possibility, first, it didn't seem likely; but secondly,\n02:16:55   4  there was a pattern of Mr. Epstein's associates evading\n02:16:59   5  efforts to get information from them.\n02:17:02   6           And so let me just go back to the earliest\n02:17:05   7  instance of that. According to the Chief of Police in\n02:17:07   8  the Palm Beach -- of the Palm Beach Police Department,\n02:17:11   9  Mr. Dershowitz had said that he would make available\n02:17:14  10  Mr. Epstein for questions about the -- the sex, you\n02:17:18  11  know, abuse that was going on. And, you know,\n02:17:21  12  Mr. Dershowitz had said to the Palm Beach Police\n02:17:23  13  Department, yeah, we will make him available; no, we got\n02:17:25  14  to reschedule it; you know, and then another time,\n02:17:28  15  reschedule, another time. And so there were multiple --\n02:17:32  16  according to the Chief of Police, there had been\n02:17:34  17  multiple, you know, requests to interview Mr. Epstein\n02:17:38  18  and Mr. Dershowitz had repeatedly said: Oh, yeah, we\n02:17:41  19  will schedule that, and then it hadn't happened.\n02:17:43  20           Now, obviously, there could have been a\n02:17:45  21  situation there where, you know, an emergency had come\n02:17:47  22  up for Mr. Epstein and he wasn't able to make a schedule\n02:17:49  23  or something like that. But what I saw was a -- was a\n02:17:52  24  pattern of offers to -- to meet and then withdrawals,\n02:17:55  25  and that seemed to me to be a deliberately calculated\n\n112\n02:19:07   1  available. And then that never happened -- and given the\n02:19:11   2  ten-year pattern that -- that developed -- I guess I\n02:19:12   3  should go back. I'm sorry. Let me correct my answer.\n02:19:14   4           We should go back to December 30th, 2014. So\n02:19:17   5  there -- there appeared to be about an eight-year period\n02:19:21   6  of time during which Mr. Epstein had refused to answer\n02:19:24   7  any questions about his sexual abuse of girls and yet,\n02:19:29   8  Mr. Dershowitz said, oh, it's just a scheduling issue\n02:19:30   9  and -- and we will get the Palm Beach Police Department\n02:19:33  10  to -- to, you know, to meet and -- and learn all this.\n02:19:37  11           The other thing that I'm -- that I'm seeing\n02:19:39  12  here, so now there's -- there's -- Mr. Dershowitz had\n02:19:42  13  been involved in concealing Mr. Epstein from the Palm\n02:19:46  14  Beach Police Department, but there were others that had\n02:19:47  15  done similar sorts of things.\n02:19:49  16           So one of them was a Ghislaine Maxwell. I\n02:19:55  17  will just call her Glenn Maxwell. I think that's kind\n02:19:55  18  of the nickname I understand she goes by.\n02:19:59  19           So Glenn Maxwell -- remember, she is -- she\n02:19:59  20  is the one, you know, I think the record is clear, in --\n02:20:03  21  in -- in litigation that, you know, an allegation has\n02:20:06  22  been made that she was the one that -- that brought\n02:20:08  23  Virginia Roberts into the -- into the sex trafficking,\n02:20:12  24  and was heavily involved with -- you know, on all the --\n02:20:15  25  not all the flights, but on many of the flights with\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\nPage 109 to 112 of 151\n28 of 38 sheets\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010837",
