Okay. Privileged information which I'm not\n01:15:17  16   disclosing in any way would have interacted with a vast\n01:15:20  17   body of other information.\n01:15:22  18         The vast body of other information would have\n01:15:24  19   started with an 89-page police report from the Palm\n01:15:29  20   Beach Police Department that showed for about a\n01:15:30  21   six-month period in 2005, there was sexual abuse of\n01:15:35  22   minor girls going on on a daily basis, in -- whenever\n01:15:40  23   Jeffrey Epstein was in his Palm Beach mansion.\n01:15:44  24         And on some cases, it was going on not once,\n01:15:48  25   not twice, but three times during the day. That -- let\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n66\n01:15:51   1   me just be clear. I mean, I -- I referred to the\n01:15:53   2   89-page police report. I have offered to put it into\n01:15:55   3   the record if -- if it would speed things up, but let's\n01:15:58   4   just talk about some of the things that are in that\n01:15:59   5   89-page police report.\n01:16:02   6         This was a -- a very intensive investigation\n01:16:05   7   that the Palm Beach Police Department put together.\n01:16:07   8   They did, for example, what are called trash covers;\n01:16:09   9   that is when trash came out of the -- of the mansion of\n01:16:13  10   Epstein, the police would intercept the trash and then\n01:16:16  11   they would go through the trash and look for\n01:16:17  12   incriminating information.\n01:16:19  13         And what they began to discover was memo\n01:16:22  14   pads -- and I say \"memo pads,\" let's be clear, pad after\n01:16:26  15   pad after pad, or I guess I should say, sheet after\n01:16:28  16   sheet after sheet that had the name of a girl, and then\n01:16:33  17   there was a notation of something to the effect of a\n01:16:35  18   massage.\n01:16:36  19         And so the Palm Beach Police Department began\n01:16:39  20   tracking down, well, wait a minute, these -- these are\n01:16:41  21   girls giving massages and they don't seem to have any\n01:16:44  22   specialized training in massages; they don't seem to be\n01:16:47  23   masseuses in any sense of the term; what's going on\n01:16:47  24   here?\n01:16:50  25         And so the Palm Beach Police Department\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n17 of 38 sheets\nPage 65 to 68 of 151\n\n67\n01:16:52   1   began, you know, I guess what we would call\n01:16:54   2   knock-and-talks, knocking on doors to try to get to some\n01:16:57   3   of these girls, and they would get to the girls, and\n01:16:59   4   many of them initially were -- were afraid to explain\n01:17:02   5   what had happened.\n01:17:03   6         But as they -- as they continued talking to\n01:17:06   7   them, the girls began to explain that what was happening\n01:17:09   8   was, they were going over to Epstein's house under the\n01:17:13   9   guise of giving a massage, and when they got there, the\n01:17:17  10   massage was, in fact, sexual activity.\n01:17:19  11         And for many of the girls, I think, as I say\n01:17:22  12   around 23, 24, something along those lines, they were\n01:17:25  13   underage. They were under the age of consent in\n01:17:28  14   Florida.\n01:17:28  15         And so each and every one of those events was\n01:17:30  16   a crime being perpetrated -- and let's be clear, not\n01:17:35  17   just being perpetrated by Epstein, but by other people\n01:17:36  18   who were involved there at the mansion.\n01:17:38  19         And so what the -- the Palm Beach Police\n01:17:40  20   Department was putting together was that this mansion in\n01:17:43  21   Florida was the nest of sexual abuse of young girls here\n01:17:48  22   in Florida that involved, literally, in the -- in this\n01:17:53  23   period of time, more than a hundred events that they\n01:17:57  24   were able to document of sexual abuse.\n01:17:59  25         And when you put that together with the\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n68\n01:18:01   1   pattern or practice that was being revealed there, there\n01:18:03   2   were hundreds of acts of sexual abuse going on in the\n01:18:06   3   mansion.\n01:18:07   4         But then what becomes -- and this is where I\n01:18:10   5   indicated that, you know, the answer would continue on.\n01:18:12   6   The -- the problem was that the evidence was starting to\n01:18:14   7   show that this was a much broader series of events. For\n01:18:18   8   example, there were flight logs showing that Mr. Epstein\n01:18:21   9   was then flying with underaged girls, and those flight\n01:18:27  10   logs, you know, as -- as the flight logs began to\n01:18:29  11   develop, for example, we have seen, I know in the last\n01:18:32  12   day or two here, one underage girl was Virginia Roberts\n01:18:35  13   who is on the flight, you know, with Epstein, and with\n01:18:39  14   Maxwell, and those sorts of things.\n01:18:41  15         So you start to look at the flight logs and\n01:18:43  16   you see what's going on is not just events that are\n01:18:46  17   occurring in Florida, but it's occurring on a\n01:18:50  18   multi-state basis, which now starts to make it a federal\n01:18:53  19   crime. For example, we are seeing evidence that --\n01:18:56  20   let's just talk about Virginia Roberts since she's\n01:18:58  21   central to this case.\n01:18:59  22         We are seeing Virginia Roberts being flown\n01:19:02  23   from Florida to New York where she's in the clutches of\n01:19:07  24   Jeffrey Epstein who is sexually abusing her, you know,\n01:19:12  25   many times a week.
