Serious federal offenses.\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n70\n01:20:22   1       But then that evidence extended, you know,\n01:20:26   2   more broadly than that. The evidence also started to\n01:20:28   3   show, again, if we talk just about flight logs, that\n01:20:31   4   the -- that underage girls such as Virginia Roberts were\n01:20:34   5   being flown internationally from, for example, Teterboro\n01:20:39   6   in New York to -- to locations, just to pick one, you\n01:20:42   7   know, for example, in London, where again sexual abuse\n01:20:45   8   was occurring.\n01:20:47   9           And so you started to put together this\n01:20:50  10   pattern of criminality that was started in this -- you\n01:20:54  11   know, I don't know what the right word is here. I don't\n01:20:56  12   want to -- I don't want to -- you know, you've heard\n01:20:58  13   discussions of hyperbole and things like that, but we\n01:21:01  14   have got this nest of -- of -- and I won't say snakes,\n01:21:04  15   but we have this nest of criminals in Florida, but it --\n01:21:07  16   it seems to be spreading to Epstein's mansion in New\n01:21:10  17   York; it seems to be spreading to Ghislaine Maxwell's\n01:21:14  18   flat in London, and -- and -- and it goes on.\n01:21:17  19           So those are the kinds of things that would\n01:21:19  20   have formed the -- the -- the basis, particularly when\n01:21:25  21   you -- when you start to add in this fact: What the\n01:21:28  22   Palm -- going back now to Florida with the Palm Beach\n01:21:31  23   Police Department. What the Palm Beach Police\n01:21:33  24   Department has -- had discovered was not a one-off kind\n01:21:35  25   of event, you know, on one particular day, one\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\nPage 69 to 72 of 151\n\n71\n01:21:37   1   particular girl had been sexually abused.\n01:21:40   2           What the Palm Beach Police Department had\n01:21:42   3   discovered was brazen, notorious, repetitive activity\n01:21:46   4   sometimes occurring as often as three times in a\n01:21:48   5   particular day. And so that led me to believe that the\n01:21:51   6   sexual activity that was going on in Florida was such\n01:21:54   7   that someone who was a regular house guest there would\n01:21:57   8   have immediately come to the conclusion that, well,\n01:22:00   9   look, gee, there are these underage girls coming in here\n01:22:03  10   and they -- they seem to be -- you know, they don't seem\n01:22:06  11   to be here to be doing, you know, business activities;\n01:22:08  12   they -- they might be here doing other kinds of\n01:22:11  13   activities. So those would be the kinds of things that\n01:22:13  14   would -- would have formed the factual basis.\n01:22:15  15           There are other things as well, but I'm sure\n01:22:17  16   you want to ask other questions in addition to that. So\n01:22:18  17   I'll stop there, but those -- that's -- I think gives\n01:22:22  18   you a small flavor of the kind of evidence that, you\n01:22:24  19   know, was form -- undergirding the allegations that were\n01:22:28  20   being presented here.\n01:22:32  21       Q.  It sounds like you quite passionately believe\n01:22:35  22   that there was strong evidence that Mr. Epstein had\n01:22:39  23   engaged in sexual misconduct; is that right?\n01:22:41  24       A.  I think \"strong\" understates it.\n01:22:44  25       Q.  In the course of that long answer, you didn't\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n72\n01:22:48   1   mention Professor Dershowitz's name once.\n01:22:51   2       A.  I said flight logs. And let's talk about\n01:22:53   3   flight logs.\n01:22:54   4       Q.  Let me back up. You didn't answer his\n01:22:57   5   name -- mention his name once; is that -- is that your\n01:23:00   6   recollection as well?\n01:23:00   7       A.  That's correct. We were talking about a\n01:23:02   8   factual basis, and I'll be glad -- I told you that there\n01:23:05   9   were other things if you want, factual basis for -- for\n01:23:07  10   Mr. Dershowitz. I'll be glad to add that in. Let me --\n01:23:10  11   let's -- let me -- let me -- I would like to supplement\n01:23:11  12   my answer then if I could.\n01:23:12  13       Q.  Do you want to look at a document?\n01:23:14  14       A.  Yes.\n01:23:14  15       Q.  Let me first -- have we exhausted your\n01:23:16  16   recollection without documents of all the evidence that\n01:23:21  17   you would refer to to support the allegation that\n01:23:23  18   Professor Dershowitz abused other minors?\n01:23:26  19       A.
