They’re lying.\n\nQuestion: They show letters in which they offered to depose you.\n\nAnswer: And they didn’t show my letters in response saying, (a), if you ask me about\nmy legal relationship with Epstein and I’ll be happy to answer. . . . And I responded\nthat I would be happy to be deposed if you could give me any indication that I would\nbe a relevant witness. . . .

We [Epstein and Dershowitz] had an academic\nrelationship. I was never in the presence of a single, young, underaged\nwoman. When I was with him, it was with prominent scientists, prominent\nacademics. And they’re just – again – lying about this. I never saw him doing\nanything improper. I was not a participant. I was not a witness.\n\nToday Show, Jan. 22, 2015 (emphases added).\n\nAs another example, in Miami Herald, Dershowitz called the Joinder Motion that he\nseeks to have sealed “the sleaziest legal document I have ever seen.
