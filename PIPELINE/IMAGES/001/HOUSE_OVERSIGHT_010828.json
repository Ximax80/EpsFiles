SIMPSON: And -- and I'll give you an\n01:23:47   3      opportunity to look at that --\n01:23:47   4         THE WITNESS: Sure --\n01:23:47   5      BY MR. SIMPSON:\n01:23:48   6         Q.   -- but I'm entitled to ask first about your\n01:23:50   7      recollection.\n01:23:51   8         A.   Okay.\n01:23:51   9         Q.   Based on your recollection --\n01:23:51  10         A.   Right.\n01:23:52  11         Q.   -- I want to know all the evidence --\n01:23:52  12         A.   Right.\n01:23:54  13         Q.   -- you were relying on here.\n01:23:55  14         A.   So what -- what I'm going to do is, I'm going\n01:23:57  15      to make a list here on my -- on my notepad of all the\n01:23:59  16      things, and then I'm going to compare that with notes I\n01:24:01  17      have here. There may be a couple things that I don't\n01:24:03  18      cover.\n01:24:03  19         Q.   As long as your counsel is okay with that.\n01:24:04  20         A.   Yeah.\n01:24:05  21         Q.   You understand you'll have to give that to\n01:24:07  22      me?\n01:24:07  23         A.   Yeah. I'll give you the notes --\n01:24:07  24         Q.   All right.\n01:24:09  25         A.   -- and then I will compare with what I've got\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n19 of 38 sheets\n\n75\n01:25:38   1      Mr. Epstein saying that she had been trafficked,\n01:25:41   2      sexually trafficked, you know, not just abused by\n01:25:44   3      Mr. Epstein, but now being forcibly sent to, you know,\n01:25:46   4      other people to abuse.\n01:25:49   5         And in the categories of people that were\n01:25:52   6      sexually abusing her were academicians, and I knew that\n01:25:56   7      Mr. Dershowitz fell within that category of -- of being\n01:25:58   8      an academician. The -- that complaint also indicated\n01:26:00   9      that there might be flight logs that would show that\n01:26:05  10      Virginia Roberts had been sexually abused in these\n01:26:08  11      various locations. And that started to indicate to me\n01:26:13  12      that there might be what the law refers to as a common\n01:26:16  13      scheme or plan. And that, just as Virginia Roberts was\n01:26:19  14      being trafficked to these powerful people in various\n01:26:23  15      places, there might well be other girls.\n01:26:26  16         And so I have mentioned a flight log, and let\n01:26:28  17      you -- you wanted to ask about Mr. Dershowitz. On --\n01:26:31  18      on December 30th, 2009, I was aware that there was a\n01:26:35  19      flight log showing Mr. Dershowitz flying with Tatiana,\n01:26:39  20      who as far as I can tell was not a business person, was\n01:26:44  21      not providing financial advice or something else.\n01:26:49  22         I understood that Mr. Epstein was a\n01:26:51  23      billionaire who was heavily involved in financial\n01:26:53  24      issues. I knew that Tatiana was on a plane with\n01:26:57  25      Mr. Dershowitz, and then there was also, if I recall\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n74\n01:24:11   1      there. So I mentioned the Palm Beach Police Department\n01:24:14   2      report.\n01:24:15   3         The next thing that I want to mention is the\n01:24:19   4      Jane Doe 102 complaint. In August of 2009, Bob\n01:24:22   5      Josefsberg -- who is, from what I understood, a very\n01:24:27   6      well-regarded lawyer here in Florida; in fact, a lawyer\n01:24:32   7      that was selected by the United States Government to\n01:24:33   8      represent a number of the -- of the girls that had been\n01:24:36   9      sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein. He was -- he was\n01:24:40  10      part of the procedure that was including the\n01:24:43  11      nonprosecution agreement.\n01:24:45  12         In August of 2009, he filed a complaint on\n01:24:46  13      behalf of Virginia Roberts. That complaint indicated\n01:24:48  14      that Virginia Roberts had been sexually abused in\n01:24:54  15      Florida, in New York, and in -- in other places, as I\n01:24:58  16      recall. The thing that -- that I particularly recall\n01:25:02  17      was that Mr. Josefsberg had said, Virginia Roberts was\n01:25:06  18      abused by -- and he gave some categories of people.\n01:25:12  19         He mentioned, I think, business people. He\n01:25:15  20      mentioned royalty, and he mentioned academicians. And\n01:25:17  21      so to tie into your question, I knew that Professor\n01:25:23  22      Dershowitz was an academician. And so what I was seeing\n01:25:25  23      now was, that according to a very, very respected\n01:25:29  24      attorney here in Florida, he had found Virginia Roberts\n01:25:32  25      to be credible, and had filed a lawsuit against\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n76\n01:27:01   1      correctly, working from memory as -- as you were\n01:27:01   2      wondering about, there was a notation that\n01:27:04   3      Mr. Dershowitz was on a plane with one female.\n01:27:06   4         And so I was -- when I looked at that, I'm\n01:27:08   5      seeing Mr. Dershowitz on a -- on a flight with a woman\n01:27:11   6      who doesn't seem to be there for, frankly, anything other\n01:27:15   7      than sexual purposes or something along those lines with\n01:27:18   8      Mr. Epstein, with Mr. Epstein, who is a sex trafficker,\n01:27:21   9      and with one female which seemed to me to be a potential\n01:27:25  10      entry for disguising international sex trafficking. So\n01:27:29  11      that was of concern.\n01:27:30  12         I then began to look at, well, I wonder, how\n01:27:33  13      would I find out if Mr. Dershowitz had been abusing\n01:27:34  14      other girls? Let's see. I knew that Virginia Roberts\n01:27:36  15      had been forced to -- to -- to -- to do this sort of\n01:27:39  16      thing.\n01:27:48  17         MS. McCAWLEY: You're okay as long as\n01:27:56  18      you're -- if you're revealing something that's in\n01:27:56  19      an affidavit --\n01:27:59  20         THE WITNESS: That's right.\n01:27:59  21         MS. McCAWLEY: -- that she submitted, you're\n01:27:59  22      fine.\n01:28:00  23         THE WITNESS: Right. So -- so what...\n01:28:05  24      Let's see.
