So you now are withdrawing the\n2   statement that you made that Virginia Roberts said\n3   that Bill Clinton was with her at an orgy on\n4   Jeffrey's island; that was wrong?\n5       A. I don't know whether she ever said that.\n6   I would not repeat that statement and have not\n7   repeated that statement based on her denial. As\n8   soon as she denied it, I never again made that\n9   statement and would not again make that statement.\n10      Q. You --\n11      A. But I did reiterate the fact that she\n12  committed perjury when she said she was on the\n13  island with Bill Clinton.\n14      MR. SCAROLA: Move to strike the\n15  nonresponsive --\n16      A. That was the perjurious statement.\n17      MR. SCAROLA: Move to strike the\n18  nonresponsive portions of the answer.\n19  BY MR. SCAROLA:\n20      Q. You have made a reference during that same\n21  CNN interview to this woman, referring to Virginia\n22  Roberts, having a criminal record?\n23      A. That's right.\n24      Q. Okay. What -- what is a criminal record?\n25      A. Well, the way I used the term is that she\n\n211\n1   Your client is doing everything he can to avoid\n2   giving direct answers to these questions.\n3       I would appreciate it if you would take a\n4   break, counsel your client that the speeches\n5   are not helpful to anyone, and especially not\n6   helpful to him.\n7       MR. SCOTT: If you want to take a break,\n8   I'll take a break and I will advise my client\n9   whatever I feel is appropriate, not what you\n10  instruct me to do.\n11      MR. SCAROLA: Okay. Well, if you think it\n12  might help at all in the progress of this\n13  deposition, then I do want to take a break. If\n14  you don't think taking a break would be\n15  helpful, I don't want to take a break.\n16      MR. SCOTT: Do you want to take a break or\n17  not?\n18      THE WITNESS: I'm going to leave it to\n19  your judgment. I'm happy to proceed --\n20      MR. SCOTT: Okay. I'll be glad to take a\n21  break.\n22      MR. SCAROLA: Thank you.\n23      MR. SCOTT: I can't say --\n24      MR. SCAROLA: Five minutes.\n25      MR. SCOTT: -- it will help you or\n\n210\n1   committed a crime and legal -- some kind of\n2   proceedings resulted from her committing a crime.\n3   The crime she committed was stealing money from a\n4   restaurant that she worked at while she was also\n5   working for Jeffrey Epstein. And it was my\n6   information that there was a criminal record of her\n7   theft.\n8       Q. How old was she at the time this alleged\n9   offense occurred?\n10      A. I don't know. But old enough to be held\n11  criminally responsible in the State of Florida, to\n12  my knowledge. To my knowledge, I -- I recall a case\n13  where a 14-year-old boy was sentenced as an adult\n14  for --\n15      MR. SCAROLA: Mr. Scott --\n16      A. -- a serious --\n17      MR. SCAROLA: -- did my question ask\n18  anything about a 14-year-old boy?\n19      A. You asked if --\n20      MR. SCAROLA: Do we really need to listen\n21  to this?\n22      MR. SCOTT: You're asking questions, my\n23  client is providing his response.\n24      MR. SCAROLA: No, your client is not\n25  responding. Your client is filibustering.\n\n212\n1   anything but --\n2       MR. SCAROLA: I can understand that you\n3   don't -- you don't have that control, but if\n4   there's any reasonable --\n5       MR. SCOTT: You know, Counsel --\n6       MR. SCAROLA: -- prospect that it might\n7   help, let's give it a try.\n8       MR. SCOTT: You know, I really don't\n9   appreciate the comments about my abilities as\n10  an attorney, like I don't have that control and\n11  things of nature. It really is --\n12      MR. SCAROLA: I don't have the control\n13  either.\n14      MR. SCOTT: It's not --\n15      MR. SCAROLA: I'm not trying to disparage\n16  you at all in any respect. I'm just suggesting\n17  that --\n18      MR. SCOTT: Okay.\n19      MR. SCAROLA: -- there is reason to doubt\n20  that it will do any good. But I want to give\n21  it a try.\n22      MR. SCOTT: Okay.
