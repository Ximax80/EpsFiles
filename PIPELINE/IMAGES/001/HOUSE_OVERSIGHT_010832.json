And so that, to me,\n01:40:30   9   was suggesting that Mr. Rodriguez had identified, you\n01:40:35  10   know, Alan Dershowitz as somebody who had information\n01:40:38  11   about this -- this international sex trafficking ring.\n01:40:40  12             But just as a side note, but an important\n01:40:42  13   note, when the -- the thing that was circled on the Alan\n01:40:46  14   Dershowitz page was not a single phone number\n01:40:49  15   indicating, you know, somebody had bumped -- you know,\n01:40:51  16   Epstein had bumped into at one point. I believe there\n01:40:56  17   were 10 or 11 phone numbers that were associated with\n01:40:57  18   Mr. Dershowitz that had all been circled and an e-mail\n01:41:00  19   address as well.\n01:41:02  20             So that started to corroborate my sense that\n01:41:05  21   Mr. Dershowitz was, indeed, a very close friend of\n01:41:10  22   Jeffrey Epstein. Now, I had then continued to do --\n01:41:14  23   there's been reference today to, you know, using Google\n01:41:16  24   to do research and so forth. So I Googled Jeffrey\n01:41:20  25   Epstein and one of the things that pops up rather\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n90\n01:41:22   1   rapidly is an article in Vanity Fair.\n01:41:25   2             And what you see in that article is, you\n01:41:28   3   know, discussion about Mr. Epstein, but when you're\n01:41:33   4   trying to do a profile of someone, you try to figure out\n01:41:34   5   who that person's closest friends are.\n01:41:35   6             And so the Vanity Fair author had gone to\n01:41:38   7   Alan Dershowitz, you know, our -- Mr. Dershowitz here,\n01:41:42   8   and had asked him, hey, what do you know about Jeffrey\n01:41:45   9   Epstein?\n01:41:46  10             And, again, off the top of my head, you want\n01:41:47  11   to know what I can remember right now. What I can\n01:41:49  12   remember right now is that in the Vanity Fair article,\n01:41:53  13   the -- in the Vanity Fair article, Mr. Dershowitz said,\n01:41:59  14   I've written 20-some odd books; there's only one person\n01:42:03  15   outside my immediate family with whom I share drafts,\n01:42:06  16   and that's Jeffrey Epstein.\n01:42:08  17             So I took that as indicating a -- a very\n01:42:10  18   close personal association that -- you know, among the\n01:42:13  19   people that -- that obviously he's sharing this -- these\n01:42:15  20   kinds of things that he wants evaluated before he shares\n01:42:18  21   them with the broader world, there's his immediate\n01:42:21  22   family and then there's -- there's Jeffrey Epstein.\n01:42:23  23             There was also another similar quote in the\n01:42:24  24   article that indicated that -- that Mr. Dershowitz said\n01:42:29  25   that he wasn't interested in Epstein just because he had\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n23 of 38 sheets\nPage 89 to 92 of 151\n\n91\n01:42:32   1   a lot of money. I mean, Epstein was identified as a\n01:42:32   2   billionaire in this article, billionaire with -- with a\n01:42:38   3   B, so the record is clear.\n01:42:39   4             But he said, look, if Epstein lost all his\n01:42:43   5   money -- I'm paraphrasing here -- I would be, you know,\n01:42:44   6   happy to walk down, you know, the Coney Island Boardwalk\n01:42:47   7   with him and discuss things with him, as -- you know,\n01:42:49   8   even if he didn't have any money.\n01:42:50   9             So now I'm seeing Dershowitz is a very close\n01:42:54  10   personal friend of Jeffrey Epstein. And then I started\n01:42:58  11   to look at flight logs. There were -- there were some\n01:43:01  12   very interesting things that I noticed on the flight\n01:43:04  13   logs.\n01:43:04  14             One of the things I noticed was when I began\n01:43:07  15   to, you know, get into this, that, you know, I was\n01:43:13  16   wondering, well, what -- well, how do these flight logs\n01:43:14  17   come into the possession of, you know, law enforcement\n01:43:16  18   agencies? And the answer turned out to be that they had\n01:43:20  19   been provided by Epstein's defense attorney and -- and,\n01:43:23  20   you know, coincidentally, I suppose, or in my mind,\n01:43:27  21   suspiciously, they were not provided by just any defense\n01:43:30  22   attorney on this rather large defense team. They were\n01:43:33  23   provided by one attorney according to Detective Recarey.\n01:43:36  24   Detective Recarey testified under oath that the flight\n01:43:39  25   logs were provided to him by Alan Dershowitz.\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n92\n01:43:41   1   So one of the things that was -- was\n01:43:43   2   interesting is, Dershowitz has had access to these\n01:43:45   3   flight logs, and now I'm beginning to wonder, well, has\n01:43:48   4   there been an opportunity to sanitize those flight logs\n01:43:50   5   or remove any incriminating information?\n01:43:52   6             And -- and one of the things that was\n01:43:54   7   interesting about the flight logs that were produced --\n01:43:56   8   I believe just so the record is clear, that was Exhibit\n01:44:02   9   1 that -- if we could -- if I could refer -- I need to\n01:44:04  10   refresh my recollection as to -- well, I don't -- you\n01:44:07  11   may not want me to look at documents.\n01:44:08  12             It was either Exhibit 1 or 2 this morning\n01:44:11  13   during Dershowitz's deposition which was covering a time\n01:44:15  14   period of January to, I believe, September 2005. These\n01:44:20  15   were flight logs that were produced by Mr. Dershowitz to\n01:44:23  16   the Palm Beach Police Department.\n01:44:25  17             And you wonder why did they stop in\n01:44:27  18   September -- you know, why stop in September 2005?\n01:44:31  19   What's the significance of that? Well, later on,\n01:44:35  20   additional flight logs were obtained, and sure enough,\n01:44:39  21   who shows up on an October 2005 flight log with Jeffrey\n01:44:45  22   Epstein? Mr. Dershowitz.\n01:44:46  23             So that led to a suspicion that\n01:44:49  24   Mr. Dershowitz had provided to the Palm Beach Police\n01:44:52  25   Department flight logs that, the time period of which\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010832",
