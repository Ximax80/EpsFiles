SIMPSON: I'm -- I think I get to ask the\n02:11:36   3    questions, but I was going to ask the same\n02:11:38   4    question.\n02:11:39   5                MR. SCAROLA: Wonderful. We are on the same\n02:11:40   6    page.\n02:11:40   7    BY MR. SIMPSON:\n02:11:41   8         Q.   Mr. Cassell, you -- you mentioned that you\n02:11:43   9    had something that you had prepared --\n02:11:44  10         A.   Yes.\n02:11:44  11         Q.   -- that would summarize --\n02:11:46  12         A.   Right.\n02:11:46  13         Q.   -- your knowledge.\n02:11:48  14         A.   Right.\n02:11:48  15         Q.   And now that you have exhausted your\n02:11:51  16    recollection, could you produce that and let's just mark\n02:11:54  17    it --\n02:11:54  18         A.   Yeah, sure.\n02:11:55  19         Q.   -- as an exhibit?\n02:11:56  20                MR. SIMPSON: We are up to Exhibit 3, I\n02:11:59  21    believe. Cassell 3.\n02:12:01  22                THE WITNESS: Right. Now, there -- there are\n02:12:01  23    two parts to this --\n02:12:02  24                MR.

I just want the record\n02:12:06   2    to be clear, that I'm only looking -- there's --\n02:12:07   3    there's a pre-December 30th section and a\n02:12:10   4    post-December 30th section, so the top part is\n02:12:13   5    the -- is what I was working off of.\n02:12:13   6    BY MR. SIMPSON:\n02:12:15   7         Q.   Okay.\n02:12:15   8         A.   Now, underneath this is -- you know, if you\n02:12:18   9    have questions about what happened after December 30th.\n02:12:19  10         Q.   So you're -- you're prepared to produce the\n02:12:22  11    entire document, but you're clarifying? I don't -- I\n02:12:24  12    don't want to ask you -- if you're going to use it in\n02:12:26  13    your testimony, then we will mark the whole thing.\n02:12:27  14                MR. SCAROLA: Mark the whole thing. You can\n02:12:30  15    use it.\n02:12:30  16                MR. SIMPSON: Mark the whole thing and I'll\n02:12:30  17    ask you about it.\n02:12:30  18                THE WITNESS: That would be great.\n02:12:33  19    Absolutely.\n02:12:33  20                MR. SIMPSON: All right. I'm going to ask\n02:12:35  21    the court reporter to mark as Cassell Exhibit 3,\n02:12:39  22    a one-page document that the witness has just\n02:12:42  23    handed to me. It's mostly typed. It has some\n02:12:44  24    handwriting on it.\n02:12:45  25         (Cassell I.D. Exhibit No. 3 - one-page\n\n                  ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n                         (954) 331-4400\n\n27 of 38 sheets\n\n107\n02:12:45   1    document produced by the witness was marked for\n02:12:45   2    identification.)\n02:13:10   3                THE WITNESS: All right. So let me -- if I\n02:13:11   4    could look at this to see if it -- the top\n02:13:13   5    portion of it to see if it refreshes my\n02:13:13   6    recollection about --\n02:13:13   7    BY MR. SIMPSON:\n02:13:16   8         Q.   Could I just see it for one second?\n02:13:18   9         A.   Sure. Absolutely.\n02:13:21  10         Q.   All right. Yeah. Let me just clarify one\n02:13:27  11    point before you do that.\n02:13:27  12         A.   Yes, sir.\n02:13:27  13         Q.   In your answer, were you referring to the\n02:13:28  14    evidence you could recall or the information you could\n02:13:30  15    recall that supported your allegations as to both\n02:13:34  16    Virginia Roberts and other minors, or were you treating\n02:13:36  17    those separately?\n02:13:37  18         A.   No, I was not treating those separately. I\n02:13:39  19    was -- for me, there's a common -- what -- what the law\n02:13:42  20    refers to as a common scheme or plan in a --\n02:13:42  21         Q.   Okay.\n02:13:44  22         A.   -- a criminal conspiracy for international\n02:13:46  23    trafficking that involved not just a single girl, but\n02:13:49  24    multiple girls. So the answer was -- was with respect\n02:13:52  25    to -- to multiple girls.\n\n                  ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n                         (954) 331-4400\n\n108\n02:13:53   1         Q.   Okay. So I may have some questions to\n02:13:56   2    distinguish further between those two --\n02:13:57   3         A.   Yes.\n02:13:58   4         Q.   -- but is it fair to say that -- and I\n02:14:02   5    realize you're going to refresh your recollection, but\n02:14:05   6    that you had exhausted your recollection of the basis\n02:14:07   7    for the allegation in this Exhibit 2, the motion to join\n02:14:14   8    as to both Miss Roberts and other minors?\n02:14:17   9         A.   Yes.\n02:14:17  10         Q.   Okay. So then, now, take a look at that and\n02:14:20  11    tell me if there's anything there that refreshes your\n02:14:25  12    recollection as to something that you have not yet told\n02:14:28  13    me about.\n02:14:29  14         A.   So this refreshes my recollection. Sarah\n02:14:46  15    Kellen. I think I referred to her as Miss Kellen.\n02:14:49  16    Sarah Kellen was the first name.\n02:14:52  17                Nadia Marcinkova, Nadia was the first name\n02:14:53  18    there. Adrianna Mucinska was the full name of those --\n02:14:58  19    that's the second echelon of the -- of the -- of the\n02:15:00  20    criminal conspiracy.\n02:15:06  21                Oh, this refreshes my recollection that\n02:15:08  22    Jeffrey Epstein had answered some questions in the civil\n02:15:11  23    litigation. He provided, for example, names of -- of\n02:15:15  24    some people who were involved, but he took the Fifth\n02:15:18  25    when asked -- he took -- he provided names of some\n\n                  ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n                         (954) 331-4400\n\nPage 105 to 108 of 151                                10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\n\n                                                  HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010836",
