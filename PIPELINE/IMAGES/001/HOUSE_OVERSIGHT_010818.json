SCOTT: Well, let him -- let him read\n5  the exhibit.\n6     A. What -- what's the date?\n7        BY MR. SCAROLA:\n8     Q. December 11.\n9     A. December 11. Yes, I see that.\n10    Q. Palm Beach International Airport to\n11 Teterboro?\n12    A. Right, yeah.\n13    Q. Passengers, Jeffrey Epstein?\n14    A. Right.\n15    Q. GM, a reference to Ghislaine -- excuse me,\n16 Ghislaine Maxwell.\n17    A. Uh-huh.\n18    Q. And ET and Virginia, right?\n19    A. That's what it says, yes, sir.\n20    Q. And then we see three of the same four\n21 passengers leaving the New York area.\n22    A. Uh-huh.\n23    Q. To fly to another destination three days\n24 later on December 14, correct?\n25    A. Yes.\n\n319\n1  that, but that you were in New York at the same time\n2  Jeffrey Epstein --\n3     A. And that Carolyn --\n4     Q. -- and Virginia were in New York and you\n5  were --\n6     A. And that Carolyn arranged for a massage.\n7     Q. -- having a massage.\n8     A. And that my wife arranged for a massage.\n9     Q. No, I didn't say that at all, sir?\n10          MR. SCOTT: Well, that's what he's saying\n11 that the record reflects.\n12    A. The record --\n13          MR. SCOTT: Don't cut him off.\n14    A. -- reflects that Carolyn -- Carolyn always\n15 wanted me to have massages because she thought it\n16 would relax me. I don't like massages particularly,\n17 but when Carolyn arranged massages, almost always we\n18 had them together at the same time. We would have\n19 the same masseuse, sometimes a man, sometimes a\n20 woman, come to the house and give us massages\n21 together.\n22          The idea that my wife would arrange for me\n23 to have a massage with an underage girl for sexual\n24 purposes is so bizarre and absurd as to defy any\n25 kind of credibility, but go on.\n\n318\n1     Q. And let's look at the next page of your\n2  wife's diary for December 13, the period of time\n3  when the flight log shows Jeffrey Epstein and\n4  Virginia in New York --\n5     A. Uh-huh.\n6     Q. -- at the same time when it would appear\n7  that you were in New York. And at the bottom of\n8  this calendar, Wednesday, December 13, A.D.,\n9  massage, right?\n10    A. 10:00 a.m. it says? What is it?\n11    Q. It says 10, 10-A.D. massage?\n12    A. Yeah.\n13    Q. Okay.\n14          Let's go to the next composite.\n15    A. I don't have -- there's another page after\n16 that. Oh, the next composite.\n17    Q. Yes, sir.\n18    A. Yeah.\n19    Q. Composite Number 10.\n20    A. Uh-huh. But -- but I just want to be\n21 clear. So you're saying Carolyn was with me in\n22 New York during that period of time.\n23    Q. No, I'm not saying that at all, sir. I\n24 suggest that when we take a close look at the\n25 calendar, it's going to reveal something other than\n\n320\n1        BY MR. SCAROLA:\n2     Q. Yes.

I guess I --\n8           MR. SCAROLA: Well, I'm missing the humor\n9  too.\n10       BY MR. SCAROLA:\n11    Q. Let's go to Composite Exhibit Number 10.\n12    A. Yeah.\n13    Q. The first page of that composite exhibit\n14 is a photocopy of pages from your personal calendar\n15 in January 2001, correct?\n16    A. That's right, yes.\n17    Q. Another Court TV appearance on January 11,\n18 correct?\n19    A. January 11.\n20    Q. Yes, sir. Thursday, January 11, entry in\n21 the left-hand column, Court TV.\n22    A.
