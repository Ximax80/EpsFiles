I probably did not read all the reports on\n9       Jeffrey Epstein. I'm sure I've read some of them.\n10      I do not recall --\n11           MR.

To the extent that Bradley Edwards and\n18      Paul Cassell relied upon detailed reports from the\n19      Palm Beach police department in order to assess the\n20      credibility of Virginia Roberts, would it be\n21      reasonable for them to rely upon police reports?\n22           A. I would hope that they would rely on all\n23      the police reports, including the ones that showed\n24      that she was involved in criminal actions, including\n25      the ones that would show that she took money as an\n\n299\n1       this.\n2            A. Excuse me one second.\n3            MR. SCOTT: You know, you think this is\n4       funny and I think this man's -- and I think\n5       this man's --\n6            MR. SCAROLA: I think it's improper for\n7       you to be coaching the witness in the middle of\n8       examination. If you think that there's\n9       something that needs to be brought out, you do\n10      that in cross examination. You don't feed him\n11      information that you want him to be reading in\n12      the middle of my examination of this witness.\n13           MR. SCOTT: No. But it's also true that\n14      under our rules, when you read portions of a\n15      deposition, he has the ability to read other\n16      portions of the deposition which clarify the\n17      answers. That's done in every courtroom on\n18      every time a witness -- you have selected\n19      portions of it that are not accurate based on\n20      other portions and I am having him review them\n21      since you did not offer him the deposition to\n22      review.\n23           MR. SCAROLA: And that's what you do --\n24           MR. SCOTT: And I think that's totally\n25      proper --\n\n298\n1       adult to provide sexual services to people.\n2            I would hope they would look at all the\n3       reports, not just selected portions of those\n4       reports.\n5            Q. Would that include the reports of the\n6       Federal Bureau of Investigation?\n7            A. I would hope so.\n8            Q. Would that include the information\n9       provided by the U.S. Attorney's Office?\n10           A. I would sure hope so, and I could tell you\n11      that the --\n12           Q.

Let me just say that the U.S. Attorney's\n14      Office has told me unequivocally that my name never\n15      came up in any context of any accusation against me\n16      during the negotiations.\n17           Q. Is this part of your work product that\n18      you're waiving right now?\n19           MR. SWEDER: No, no.\n20           A.
