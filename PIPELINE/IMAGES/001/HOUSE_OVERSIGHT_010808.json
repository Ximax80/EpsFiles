SCAROLA:\n2          Q. Is it your contention that that testimony,\n3      under oath, of your friend, Mr. Epstein's staff\n4      person, exonerates you?\n5          A. First, a little background. Mr. Alessi\n6      was fired for theft of material from Mr. Epstein, so\n7      Mr. Alessi was not on a friendly basis with Jeffrey\n8      Epstein.\n9          Second, the description of the dildos and\n10     sex toys clearly refers to the area of the house\n11     that I was never in, the area of Ms. Maxwell's room,\n12     rather than the area of the room that I stayed in.\n13         Third, he gives no timeframe for the\n14     visits.\n15         And, fourth, he certainly didn't in any\n16     way confirm that I was there while Virginia Roberts\n17     was there. His answer was simply that I was there\n18     from time to time. He's wrong about that. During\n19     the relevant timeframe, I was never in the house.\n20         And even taking outside the relevant\n21     timeframe, the only time I was in the house for more\n22     than one day was when my family, my wife, my son, my\n23     daughter-in-law, my then probably seven or\n24     eight-year-old granddaughter, who just graduated\n25     Harvard, and my probably four-year-old grandson, who\n\n280\n1      BY MR. SCAROLA:\n2          Q. The question was: Is that part of the\n3      time that you claim exonerates you?\n4          A. Well, I think if you read the whole\n5      testimony, it clearly exonerates me and I think that\n6      part of the testimony in no way inculpates me and no\n7      reasonable person reading that could use that as a\n8      basis for making allegations that I had sexual\n9      encounters or misconduct with Virginia Roberts.\n10         So, when -- if that's the best testimony\n11     that your unprofessional clients relied on, then\n12     clearly that exonerates me.\n13         Again, the absence of evidence is evidence\n14     of absence. And the very idea that this is seen as\n15     some basis for concluding that I had sexual\n16     encounters with -- with Virginia Roberts, why wasn't\n17     he asked did he ever see me have a massage by\n18     Virginia Roberts? Did he ever see me have a sexual\n19     encounter with Virginia Roberts? Did he ever go to\n20     the room I was staying in and find any sex toys?\n21         The answers to all those questions, if\n22     truthful, would be no.\n23         Q. What was Mr. Alessi's motive against you?\n24     You've told us he was fired by Jeffrey Epstein, so\n25     he may have had some motive against Mr. Epstein.\n\n26 (Pages 277 to 280)\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888) 811-3408\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010808",
