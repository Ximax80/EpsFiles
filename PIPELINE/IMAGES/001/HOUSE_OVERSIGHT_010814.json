You think a professional\n5   lawyer would make these allegations based on \"I\n6   don't know, sir.\"\n7           MR. SCAROLA: Is there a question pending,\n8   Mr. Scott?\n9           MR. SCOTT: He's reading -- you asked him\n10  what he was reading --\n11          MR. SCAROLA: Yes, sir.\n12          MR. SCOTT: -- from and I had him publish\n13  it.\n14          MR. SCAROLA: Yeah, I know, and then he\n15  went on to make a speech. So I know I don't\n16  have to do it, but I'm compelled to move to\n17  strike the unresponsive speeches.\n18          MR. SCOTT: And I consider these to be a\n19  response to the interrogation that you did\n20  taking excerpts improperly and not having the\n21  entire record in front of him, which he's\n22  entitled to do to make that the record is\n23  complete. And I intend to protect him in that\n24  way.\n25\n\n303\n1           A. Let me answer. \"Rely\" connotes to me that\n2   they would place a heavy emphasis on that to the\n3   exclusion of other things and that it would be\n4   enough. And so my answer is, yes, they certainly\n5   should have read all the reports. They certainly\n6   should have read all the transcripts. But they also\n7   should have called me, they should have made other\n8   inquiry, and they should have made sure that they\n9   read all of these depositions and reports in\n10  context.\n11          And if you're implying that there are FBI\n12  reports that in any way inculpate me, that's\n13  inconsistent with the information I have from Former\n14  Chief of Assistant Jeffrey Sloman, who was prepared\n15  to file an affidavit saying that that wasn't the\n16  case but was prevented from doing so by the Justice\n17  Department.\n18          MR.

No.\n9           Q. No?\n10          A. No. It would not be enough for them to do\n11  that --\n12          Q. I didn't ask you whether it was enough.\n13          A. You said it was --\n14          Q. I asked you: Would it reasonable for them\n15  to rely upon those sources of information in\n16  assessing the credibility of Virginia Roberts?\n17          A.

So you don't know one way or another\n11  whether those allegations are true or false?\n12          A. Neither do you. Nobody would know except\n13  two people, I imagine. But I don't know. Of course\n14  not.\n15          Q. All right.\n16          A. But I presume --\n17          Q.
