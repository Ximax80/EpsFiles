And so later on in the litigation, the sex\n01:45:30  13   abuse litigation against Epstein, flight logs were\n01:45:34  14   obtained from Dave Rogers, and it was possible to -- to\n01:45:37  15   compare -- I'm sorry.

So we are on the subject of flight\n01:46:44   6   logs.\n01:46:44   7           Flight logs showed that the flight logs\n01:46:46   8   Mr. Dershowitz had produced to Detective Recarey\n01:46:49   9   were incomplete and inaccurate. And so that led\n01:46:52  10   to concern on my part that Mr. Dershowitz had had\n01:46:55  11   an opportunity to sanitize the flight logs,\n01:46:57  12   had -- had -- had provided incomplete production,\n01:47:01  13   you know, obviously, very important production\n01:47:02  14   that the Palm Beach Police Department was looking\n01:47:05  15   at.\n01:47:06  16           Then we got some additional flight logs from\n01:47:09  17   Dave Rogers. And what those flight logs\n01:47:11  18   showed -- first off, let's talk again about\n01:47:14  19   the -- the production of those flight logs.\n01:47:17  20           My recollection is that Dave Rogers's flight\n01:47:21  21   logs were provided by Bruce Reinhart who was a\n01:47:24  22   former Assistant U.S. Attorney who had been\n01:47:26  23   inside the Southern District of Florida Office at\n01:47:29  24   a time when the Epstein case was the subject of\n01:47:32  25   regular discussion in that office.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n94\n01:46:08   1   MR.

And\n01:47:44   4   so, now, Reinhart, who appeared to be being paid\n01:47:48   5   by Mr. Epstein, and certainly was adjacent to\n01:47:49   6   Mr. Epstein's business office, was producing\n01:47:51   7   these flight logs.\n01:47:52   8           So that, again, aroused suspicion that the\n01:47:54   9   flight logs that were being produced would have\n01:47:57  10   been sanitized or inaccurate.\n01:47:58  11           But even -- I mean, you know, I think the\n01:48:00  12   problem with -- you know, you can't sanitize\n01:48:02  13   everything. That would be too suspicious. And\n01:48:04  14   so what -- what was -- was -- what was evident on\n01:48:07  15   these flight logs was, for example, approximately\n01:48:11  16   ten flights by Mr. Dershowitz with Tatiana has --\n01:48:18  17   has been discussed; with Maxwell; with Jeffrey\n01:48:21  18   Epstein. One of them had one female, which,\n01:48:25  19   again, in the context that I was looking at,\n01:48:27  20   seemed to be a potential code word for\n01:48:28  21   underage -- underage girl.\n01:48:32  22           And so those flight logs showed, you know,\n01:48:35  23   again, close association and travel with --\n01:48:40  24   with -- with -- with Mr. Dershowitz, and\n01:48:47  25   Mr. Epstein.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\nPage 93 to 96 of 151\n24 of 38 sheets\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010833",
