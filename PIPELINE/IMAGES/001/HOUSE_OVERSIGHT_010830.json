Yes, if I could conclude --\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n82\n01:31:43   1         MR. SIMPSON: All right. Could the court\n01:31:44   2   reporter read me the last two lines of your\n01:31:46   3   answer?\n01:31:46   4         THE WITNESS: Okay.\n01:31:46   5         (Thereupon, a portion of the record was read\n01:31:46   6   by the reporter.)\n01:31:46   7   BY MR. SIMPSON:\n01:32:26   8         Q.  Okay. Can you pick up then?\n01:32:27   9         A.  Sure. I'll pick up -- pick up the --\n01:32:27  10         Q.  Okay.\n01:32:31  11         A.  So I was beginning to draw an adverse\n01:32:31  12   inference when Jeffrey Epstein, who is at the heart of\n01:32:34  13   the sexual abuse of, not only Virginia Roberts, but\n01:32:39  14   dozens and dozens and dozens of -- of girls literally\n01:32:40  15   scattered across the globe, takes the Fifth, refuses to\n01:32:43  16   answer the question, off the top of my head, I can't\n01:32:46  17   recall exactly, but something along lines of: Do you\n01:32:48  18   know Alan Dershowitz? And he says, I take the Fifth.\n01:32:50  19   That sort of, frankly, startled me, that -- that this\n01:32:55  20   international sex trafficker was taking the Fifth now\n01:32:57  21   when asked about Mr. Dershowitz.\n01:33:01  22         And so I was stymied in trying to get\n01:33:04  23   information from Mr. Epstein at that point. I think\n01:33:07  24   there were two depositions, if I recall correctly off\n01:33:09  25   the top of my head, that -- that I had an opportunity to\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n21 of 38 sheets\n\n83\n01:33:11   1   review, in which he took the Fifth when asked questions\n01:33:13   2   about Dershowitz.\n01:33:14   3         So, at that point, in trying to figure out,\n01:33:17   4   you know, whether Mr. Dershowitz was involved in\n01:33:20   5   sexually abusing, not only Virginia Roberts, but in\n01:33:24   6   other girls, then you go down to the next level, next\n01:33:26   7   layer of the criminal conspiracy.\n01:33:28   8         Epstein is at the top, so you go to the next\n01:33:31   9   layer. These are, you know, basically the -- the women\n01:33:33  10   who, from what I could gather, were -- were older than\n01:33:36  11   the age that Epstein wanted to sexually abuse. I think\n01:33:40  12   these were 22 and 23-year-old girls, so they had, you\n01:33:44  13   know, essentially aged out of being his sexual abuse\n01:33:47  14   victims, but they continued to -- what they would do is\n01:33:50  15   collect girls for him under the age of 18, that I guess\n01:33:53  16   was in his target range.\n01:33:55  17         And so what -- so the next person I wanted to\n01:33:58  18   talk to, you know, and get information from was Sarah\n01:34:01  19   Kellen. Sarah Kellen is on a lot of these flight logs\n01:34:04  20   with, you know, these girls that -- or women and with\n01:34:07  21   Epstein and others, and so I wanted to talk to Sarah\n01:34:07  22   Kellen.\n01:34:11  23         But what I discovered there was that, when\n01:34:15  24   Sarah Kellen was asked about Alan Dershowitz, she took\n01:34:18  25   the Fifth, and there was -- she wasn't the only one.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n84\n01:34:21   1   There was Miss Mucinska, who also took the Fifth when\n01:34:25   2   asked questions about Alan Dershowitz.\n01:34:27   3         And then there was Marcin -- Miss Marcinkova\n01:34:30   4   who also took the Fifth. So what we -- what I had at\n01:34:33   5   this point was Jeffrey Epstein's international sex\n01:34:35   6   trafficking organization. I had the next echelon, and\n01:34:38   7   both the top kingpin of the sex trafficking\n01:34:42   8   organization, and the next echelon had taken the Fifth,\n01:34:46   9   had refused to answer questions about Alan Dershowitz.\n01:34:49  10         And so, at -- at that point, I was drawing an\n01:34:51  11   adverse inference, not just from one person, but from\n01:34:54  12   four persons, and that adverse inference was being\n01:34:57  13   strengthened by the surrounding circumstances, some of\n01:35:00  14   which we have already talked about.\n01:35:00  15         One of the things that -- that really\n01:35:02  16   bolstered the adverse inference that I was drawing in\n01:35:05  17   this case was that I've mentioned those three girls,\n01:35:09  18   Kellen, Mucinska, and Marcinkova. They were all covered\n01:35:12  19   by a nonprosecution agreement. And the nonprosecution\n01:35:15  20   agreement was highly unusual.\n01:35:17  21         I -- I had been a federal prosecutor for\n01:35:18  22   about four years, I had been a federal judge for about\n01:35:21  23   five-and-a-half years, so I had seen a lot of -- of, you\n01:35:23  24   know, nonprosecution types of arrangements. And one of\n01:35:26  25   the things that was very unusual in this one is, it has\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\n\nPage 81 to 84 of 151\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010830",
