JUDGE MARRA’S ORDER IN HIS CASE DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT\nTHE RECORDS BE SEALED IN THIS CASE.\n\nDershowitz also appears to contend that Judge Marra’s order striking some of the\nmaterials from the records at issue somehow requires that these stricken materials be kept\nconfidential in this case. Dershowitz’s argument misunderstands both the scope of Judge\nMarra’s order and its effect in this case. His argument rests on a truncated – and misleading --\ndescription of the events surrounding Judge Marra’s ruling striking certain documents.
