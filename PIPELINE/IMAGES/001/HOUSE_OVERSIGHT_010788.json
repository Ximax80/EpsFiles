This looks like a picture out of a Playboy\n6\tor Penthouse magazine. It does not look to me like\n7\ta person who is under the age of 16 or 17 or 18.\n8\tBut I don't think you can tell anything from the\n9\tpicture. I think you can tell much more from\n10\tmeeting somebody and being with them and having a\n11\tconversation with them.\n12\t\tMR. SCAROLA: Let's mark this photograph,\n13\tif we could, as Exhibit Number 4.\n14\t\t(Thereupon, marked as Plaintiff\n15\tExhibit 4.)\n16\tBY MR. SCAROLA:\n17\tQ. Does Exhibit Number 4 help you at all to\n18\trecognize this young woman?\n19\t\tA. I've never -- I have no -- no recollection\n20\tof this young woman at all.\n21\t\tQ. All right. Would you describe for us,\n22\tplease, the Tatiana that you flew with Jeffrey\n23\tEpstein on November 17, 2005?\n24\t\tA. First, I want to emphasize that that's\n25\tthree years later than any of the issues involved in\n\n199\n1\tphotographs. The photographs identify the woman as\n2\tTatiana Kovylina, correct?\n3\t\tA. Yes, but --\n4\t\tMR. SCOTT: Mr. Dershowitz, take your\n5\ttime --\n6\t\tTHE WITNESS: Yeah.\n7\t\tMR. SCOTT: -- review the exhibits. Don't\n8\tbe rushed by Mr. Scarola.\n9\t\tA. Yes, it's a different -- different\n10\tspelling of the name. The Tatiana on the manifest\n11\tis spelled T-A-I-N-N-A.\n12\t\tThe Tatiana in the photograph is\n13\tT-A-T-I-N -- I-N-A. I have no idea whether --\n14\tBY MR. SCAROLA:\n15\t\tQ. The last name --\n16\t\tA. -- they are the same person.\n17\t\tQ. -- is the same, Kovylina, right?\n18\t\tA. There's no last name.\n19\t\tQ. Well, read down a little bit further, if\n20\tyou would, Mr. Dershowitz.\n21\t\tA. You mean as to a different flight?\n22\t\tQ. Yes, sir. Identifying the return flight\n23\tfor the same Tatiana.\n24\t\tA. I have no idea that it's a return flight.\n25\tI have nothing on the record that suggests that it's\n\n198\n1\tthis case. I have no recollection of flying with\n2\tthis woman. I saw the name Tatiana on a manifest.\n3\t\tAnd my recollection of Tatiana -- I have\n4\tno recollection of flying with her, but my\n5\trecollection of Tatiana is that she was a serious,\n6\tmid 20s woman friend of Jeffrey Epstein, who I may\n7\thave met on one or two or three occasions when he\n8\twas with her in -- perhaps at Harvard University\n9\twhere he was meeting with academics and scholars, or\n10\tperhaps -- I think that's probably the context\n11\twhere -- where she might have been.\n12\t\tQ. But you never flew with her?\n13\t\tA. I have no recollection of flying with her.\n14\t\tQ. Okay. Well, let me see if this helps to\n15\trefresh your recollection, Mr. Dershowitz.\n16\t\tMR. SCAROLA: Let's mark this as Exhibit\n17\tNumber 5, please.\n18\t\tTHE WITNESS: Uh-huh, yes.\n19\t\t(Thereupon, marked as Plaintiff\n20\tExhibit 5.)\n21\tBY MR. SCAROLA:\n22\t\tQ. Do you see that the name of the woman in\n23\tthe photographs I have handed you is Tatiana\n24\tKovylina, K-O-V-Y-L-I-N-A, a Victoria Secrets model?\n25\t\tThe photographs, sir, look at the\n\n200\n1\ta return flight. And it has different people on it.\n2\tSo I have no reason to believe it's a return flight.\n3\t\tQ. Is the last -- the question that I asked\n4\tyou, Mr. Dershowitz, is: Is the last name spelled\n5\texactly the same as the last name is spelled in the\n6\ttwo photographs I have shown you?\n7\t\tA. Let me look. So, on the 20th of\n8\tNovember --\n9\t\tQ. Is the last name --\n10\t\tMR. SCOTT: Whoa, whoa --\n11\tBY MR. SCAROLA:\n12\t\tQ. -- spelled the same way on both the flight\n13\tlog and the two photographs I have shown you?\n14\t\tA. On -- you mean on a flight log that I was\n15\tnot on the flight? Is that right? You're talking\n16\tabout a flight log that I was not on the flight,\n17\tright?\n18\t\tQ. That flight log shows you on multiple\n19\tflights, does it not?\n20\t\tA. It shows me not on that flight. It shows\n21\tme on a number of flights, but not on that flight.\n22\t\tMR. SCOTT: What's the date of the\n23\tflights?\n24\t\tTHE WITNESS: The date of that flight\n25\tis -- looks like November 20th, 2005, more\n\n6 (Pages 197 to 200)\n\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888) 811-3408\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010788",
