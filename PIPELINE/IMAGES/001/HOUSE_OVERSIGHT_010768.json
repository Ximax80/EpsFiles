[Y]ou [are] aware that years before December of 2014, when the\n        CVRA pleading was filed, that your name had come up repeatedly in\n        connection with Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minors, correct? . . .\n\nA.      Let me answer that question. I am aware that never before 2014,\n        end of December, was it ever, ever alleged that I had acted in any\n        way inappropriately with regard to Virginia [Giuffre], that I ever\n        touched her, that I ever met her, that I had ever been with her. I was\n        completely aware of that. There had never been any\n        allegation. She claims under oath that she told you that secretly in\n        2011, but you have produced no notes of any such conversation.\n        You, of course, are a witness to this allegation and will be deposed\n        as a witness to this allegation. I believe it is an entirely false\n        allegation that she told you in 2011 that she had had any sexual\n        contact with me. I think she's lying through her teeth when she\n        says that. And I doubt that your notes will reveal any such\n        information.\n        But if she did tell you that, she would be absolutely, categorically\n        lying. So I am completely aware that never, until the lies were put\n        in a legal pleading at the end of December 2014, it was\n        never alleged that I had any sexual contact with Virginia Roberts.\n        I know that it was alleged that I was a witness to Jeffrey Epstein's\n        alleged abuse and that was false. I was never a witness to any of\n        Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse. And I wrote that to you, something\n        that you have falsely denied. And I stand on the record. The record\n        is clear that I have categorically denied I was ever a witness to\n        any abuse, that I ever saw Jeffrey Epstein abusing anybody.\n\n        And -- and the very idea that I would stand and talk to Jeffrey\n        Epstein while he was receiving oral sex from Virginia Roberts,\n        which she swore to under oath, is so outrageous, so preposterous,\n        that even David Boies said he couldn't believe it was true.\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: I object. I object. I'm not going to allow you to reveal\nany conversations that happened in the context of a settlement discussion.\n\nTHE WITNESS: Does she have standing?",
