Let me -- the\n01:51:33  20   record should be clear, I can't recall\n01:51:34  21   immediately whether it was singular or plural.\n01:51:36  22   It may have been plural, but if it's singular, I\n01:51:36  23   don't want to suggest that there were other\n01:51:40  24   academicians, but at least one academician had\n01:51:42  25   sexually abused Jane Doe 3, according to the\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n100\n01:51:45   1   complaint that had been filed by Bob Josefsberg.\n01:51:48   2         There were two things that were of interest\n01:51:49   3   to that: One was that Mr. Epstein, the man that\n01:51:51   4   I wasn't able to get information from because he\n01:51:54   5   was invoking the Fifth, had refused or declined\n01:51:57   6   to file an answer to that complaint.\n01:52:00   7         Rather than deny the allegations, he had,\n01:52:03   8   ultimately, it's my understanding -- I don't have\n01:52:05   9   inside information and I'm not trying to waive\n01:52:07  10   any information, but my understanding is that\n01:52:09  11   rather than answer the complaint, he settled the\n01:52:11  12   case through the payment of some kind of\n01:52:13  13   compensation that Jane Doe 102 found desirable\n01:52:17  14   for dropping her claim.\n01:52:19  15         The other thing that I found interesting is\n01:52:21  16   that Josefsberg's partner, I believe it is,\n01:52:25  17   Miss Ezell, had been to some of the depositions\n01:52:29  18   of, for example, I believe Juan Alessi and\n01:52:33  19   Alfredo Rodriguez. And I believe at least one of\n01:52:35  20   those, and perhaps both of those. And she had\n01:52:36  21   asked questions about Alan Dershowitz in those\n01:52:39  22   depositions, but had not asked questions about\n01:52:42  23   other academics in those depositions.\n01:52:45  24         So that led me to conclude that Bob\n01:52:51  25   Josefsberg and his outstanding law firm had\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n25 of 38 sheets\nPage 97 to 100 of 151\n10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010834",
