SCOTT: If it involves lawyer-client\n5      privilege, don't answer it.\n6           THE WITNESS: Okay.\n7      BY MR. SCAROLA:\n8           Q. You're refusing to answer?\n9           A. No, I would like --\n10          MR. SCOTT: I've instruct you not to answer.\n11          A. -- to answer. But I've been instructed\n12     not to answer. I would like to answer.\n13          You've made a statement --\n14          MR. SCOTT: There's no question pending.\n15          THE WITNESS: But he made a statement --\n16          MR.

It means that Virginia Roberts and your\n22     clients --\n23          Q. No, sir, I haven't asked you anything\n24     about Virginia Roberts. I haven't asked you\n25     anything about my clients.\n\n255\n1      MR. INDYKE: Objection. This is Darren.\n2      Anything that relates to your conversations\n3      with Jeffrey --\n4           THE REPORTER: He's going to have to speak\n5      up.\n6           MR.

What do the words mean?\n9           A. That there was absolutely no basis for\n10     Virginia Roberts' claim that she had any sexual\n11     contact with me. That the story was entirely false.\n12     I don't know where the metaphor derives about whole\n13     cloth, but certainly that's the common\n14     understanding. And I repeat under oath that\n15     Virginia Roberts made up the entire story about\n16     having sexual contact with me out of whole cloth.\n17          Q. During the course of the same interview\n18     that we have been referencing with Hala Gorani --\n19     for the record, that's H-A-L-A, G-O-R-A-N-I.\n20          A. What page?\n21          Q.

No, I was his lawyer at that time. I'm\n14     still his lawyer.\n15          Q. Oh, what were you representing him on\n16     then --\n17          A.
