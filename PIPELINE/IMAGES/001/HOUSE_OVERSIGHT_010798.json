Let me be very clear about --\n8 Q. -- didn't it, sir?\n9 A. Let me be very clear about my media\n10 appearances so that I --\n11 Q. How about just answering the questions?\n12 A. I'm trying to answer the question. All of\n13 my media appearances --\n14 Q. The question is: Did it occur before or\n15 after your media -- your media appearances? That\n16 doesn't call for a speech --\n17 A. It came --\n18 Q. -- it calls for before or after.\n19 A. It came before some and after some. It\n20 came, for example, before my appearance on the BBC\n21 because they showed me the e-mail before they\n22 interviewed me for the BBC. So some occurred -- it\n23 occurred before some and it occurred after some.\n24 Q. All right. So it is your assertion that\n25 this single e-mail that you have made reference to\n\n239\n1 MR.
