So I\n02:08:27   7         started to look at the information on that as\n02:08:28   8         well.\n02:08:29   9             In 2009, there had been a deposition request\n02:08:34  10         sent to Mr. Dershowitz, and I -- I saw a document\n02:08:37  11         showing that that had actually been served on --\n02:08:40  12         on him, and, you know, to the extent that what I\n02:08:44  13         saw was a -- I think a receipt from the process\n02:08:48  14         server, or something along those lines, so I saw\n02:08:51  15         attempt to contact him in -- in 2009.\n02:08:53  16             And then I saw an additional attempt to\n02:08:55  17         contact him in 2011. Mr. Scarola had sent him a\n02:09:01  18         note and there was, you know, some back and\n02:09:03  19         forth. The -- the one note that -- that jumped\n02:09:06  20         out to me was one in which Mr. Scarola had\n02:09:09  21         written to Mr. Dershowitz, I think the phrase\n02:09:12  22         was: Multiple witnesses have placed you in the\n02:09:14  23         presence of Jeffrey Epstein and underage girls; I\n02:09:18  24         would like to depose you about those subjects.\n02:09:21  25             And the answer that came back was not, well,\n                       ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n                           (954) 331-4400\n10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\nPage 101 to 104 of 151\n\n103\n02:09:23   1         let me clear all of that misunderstanding up.\n02:09:25   2         You know, that's -- frankly, if I had gotten\n02:09:28   3         something like that, that's what I would have\n02:09:29   4         said.\n02:09:30   5             The answer that came back was -- from\n02:09:32   6         Mr. Dershowitz was something along the lines of,\n02:09:34   7         if I remember correctly, well, tell me what\n02:09:36   8         you -- you -- tell me what you want to know and\n02:09:38   9         I'll decide whether to cooperate, was I think\n02:09:41  10         the phrase that was used. And -- and so there\n02:09:43  11         was an attempt, you know, a 2009 attempt, a 2011\n02:09:46  12         attempt to get information from Mr. Dershowitz.\n02:09:49  13             Then there was another subpoena without\n02:09:52  14         deposition for -- for documents. You know, we\n02:09:54  15         have heard a lot about records in this case that\n02:09:57  16         could prove innocence. There was a records\n02:09:58  17         request to Mr. Dershowitz in 2013. And, again,\n02:10:01  18         my understanding was that there was no -- you\n02:10:03  19         know, no documents were provided on that.\n02:10:07  20             And so those -- I had that information.\n02:10:11  21         Another bit of information that I had was that in\n02:10:14  22         2011, I believe in early April -- this is not\n02:10:19  23         attorney/client privileged information from\n02:10:21  24         Virginia Roberts. This is a telephone call that\n02:10:23  25         she placed from Australia where she had been\n                       ESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n                           (954) 331-4400\n\n104\n02:10:27   1         essentially forced into hiding by Jeffrey\n02:10:28   2         Epstein. She managed to escape and was hiding\n02:10:31   3         out in -- in Australia, and that she would --\n02:10:36   4         that somehow, you know, Mr. Scarola and\n02:10:38   5         Mr. Edwards were able to reach her and there was\n02:10:41   6         a telephone call that was made.\n02:10:43   7             And in that telephone call she identified\n02:10:46   8         Alan Dershowitz as someone who would have\n02:10:48   9         relevant information about Jeffrey Epstein and\n02:10:50  10         the sexual abuse of underage girls.\n02:10:53  11             And so I had that information as well. So\n02:11:01  12         that, as I understand, the question was: What\n02:11:01  13         could I recall off the top of my head with regard\n02:11:05  14         to the factual basis for information connecting\n02:11:07  15         Mr. Dershowitz with the sexual abuse of minor\n02:11:12  16         girls, plural, and that, sitting here at this\n02:11:15  17         moment, is the best that I can recall for the\n02:11:18  18         information along those lines.\n02:11:18  19         BY MR.
