The next\n01:37:01   9   echelon of the trafficking organization wouldn't talk.\n01:37:03  10   So the next step was to say, okay, let's see if we can\n01:37:06  11   find somebody, you know, lower level in there, you know,\n01:37:08  12   a household employee or something like that; maybe they\n01:37:10  13   will have some information about, you know, what this\n01:37:12  14   criminal organization is doing.\n01:37:14  15           Now, let's -- let's understand, you know,\n01:37:16  16   given the pervasiveness of the -- of the criminal\n01:37:19  17   activity, I -- I wasn't convinced that they were going\n01:37:21  18   to be able to get in there and start saying exactly what\n01:37:24  19   was going on because they might well be exposing\n01:37:26  20   themselves to criminal -- you know, criminal\n01:37:29  21   culpability.\n01:37:30  22           But I -- I was able to read a sworn\n01:37:32  23   deposition from Juan Alessi, and Juan Alessi -- I\n01:37:37  24   think -- I don't know. Maybe just to speed things up\n01:37:37  25   today, I won't go through all the things that are --\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\n\n87\n01:37:40   1   that are said there, but Alessi puts Mr. Dershowitz at\n01:37:46   2   the nest of this international sex trafficking\n01:37:47   3   organization. Let's see. I think he said four or five\n01:37:51   4   times a year, two or three -- you know, two or three\n01:37:55   5   days when he goes there.\n01:37:56   6           And let's be clear, I know Mr. Dershowitz had\n01:37:58   7   said at some points like, I'm an attorney, and that's my\n01:38:00   8   client and so forth. And Alessi said, no, but this was\n01:38:03   9   not in a -- in a lawyer/client capacity; this is in a\n01:38:09  10   friend capacity.\n01:38:10  11           And so now we have Alessi putting him there\n01:38:12  12   at the same time when young girls were there. And one\n01:38:15  13   of the -- the the things that I picked up, so is\n01:38:17  14   Alessi -- you know, is he able to figure out who these\n01:38:19  15   girls are?\n01:38:20  16           A photograph of Virginia Roberts is shown to\n01:38:22  17   Juan Alessi in the deposition, and he I.D.s the\n01:38:26  18   photograph as, you know, V.R., so he -- he had, you\n01:38:30  19   know, put two and two together.\n01:38:30  20           So now I've got V.R. coming to the house at a\n01:38:34  21   time when Mr. Dershowitz is also in the house, and\n01:38:37  22   apparently spending, you know, two to three nights there\n01:38:40  23   and doing this four or five times a year.\n01:38:45  24           Now, Alessi wasn't the only one. There was\n01:38:48  25   Alfredo Rodriguez who was there in about 2004 to 2005,\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n88\n01:38:53   1   after the time period of Virginia Roberts, but it's part\n01:38:56   2   of the common scheme or plan that we've been discussing\n01:38:59   3   here.\n01:38:59   4           And so in 2005, Alfredo Rodriguez says, yeah,\n01:39:02   5   again, Mr. Dershowitz is there at a time when these\n01:39:05   6   massages are going on. When you start to look at Alessi\n01:39:09   7   and Rodriguez's statements in context where they're --\n01:39:14   8   they're saying he's there at the same time the massages\n01:39:16   9   are occurring, and with the West Palm Beach Police\n01:39:19  10   Department reports showing that massages are of a sexual\n01:39:22  11   nature, again, it started to put two and two together.\n01:39:26  12           One of the things that was particularly\n01:39:30  13   important about Rodriguez's situation was that Rodriguez\n01:39:34  14   had an access to what's been called the little black\n01:39:38  15   book, or I think he referred to it as the holy grail.\n01:39:40  16   This was Jeffrey Epstein's, you know, telephone book\n01:39:42  17   where he had telephone numbers in it.\n01:39:45  18           And so Rodriguez had that and, you know, I\n01:39:48  19   guess thought that this would be worth a lot of money\n01:39:50  20   because it would -- you know, it would identify all of\n01:39:52  21   the people that have been sexually abused by -- by\n01:39:54  22   Jeffrey Epstein. And so he tried to sell it. The FBI\n01:39:57  23   busted him for that.\n01:39:58  24           And when the FBI busted him, now he's got\n01:40:00  25   this book. And so the book went to Alessi, and\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\nPage 85 to 88 of 151\n22 of 38 sheets\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010831",
