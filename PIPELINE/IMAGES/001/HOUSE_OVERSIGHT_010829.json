No. I'm just trying to remember what I was\n01:28:12   4      thinking about with -- with regard to --\n01:28:15   5           MR.

Now I remember\n01:28:32  15      exactly what I was thinking.\n01:28:32  16           How would we go find out whether Mr. Epstein\n01:28:35  17      was lending women, or in this case, underage\n01:28:38  18      girls, to Mr. Dershowitz for sexual purposes?\n01:28:41  19      Well, the first thing I want to do was ask -- you\n01:28:45  20      know, I'd -- I'd go ask Jeffrey Epstein.\n01:28:47  21           And so what I discovered when I started to\n01:28:48  22      look at the transcripts, there were a number of\n01:28:52  23      transcripts where Mr. Epstein was asked about\n01:28:55  24      Alan Dershowitz.  And rather than say, well, no,\n01:28:57  25      he wasn't involved in any of these illegal\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n79\n01:29:47   1           MS.

There was never\n01:30:03  14      anyone who jumped to their feet at any time\n01:30:06  15      during the course of the last two days.  The only\n01:30:08  16      person who keeps jumping up is Alan Dershowitz.\n01:30:13  17      Have him pass you a note quietly, if you would,\n01:30:16  18      please.\n01:30:18  19           MR.

He\n01:29:05   3      exercised his right against compelled\n01:29:05   4      self-incrimination and refused to answer the\n01:29:09   5      question, which since these were civil cases,\n01:29:11   6      indicated to me, since he was being represented\n01:29:14   7      by very experienced legal counsel, that there was\n01:29:16   8      more than an insignificant risk of incriminating\n01:29:19   9      himself if he answered that.\n01:29:20  10           And so Jeffrey Epstein now had taken the\n01:29:23  11      Fifth.  And one of the things that I was aware of\n01:29:26  12      having been involved in, you know, civil\n01:29:28  13      litigation and criminal litigation in other\n01:29:30  14      cases, was that once somebody refuses to answer a\n01:29:32  15      question like, you know:  Do you know\n01:29:35  16      Mr. Dershowitz?  And they take the Fifth on that,\n01:29:38  17      that you're then entitled to draw what's called\n01:29:40  18      an adverse inference.  You can -- you can infer\n01:29:42  19      that, well, if they answered that question, they\n01:29:44  20      would have --\n01:29:44  21           MR.
