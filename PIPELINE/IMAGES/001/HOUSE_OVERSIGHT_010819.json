And on the 26th on Friday,\n14     another Court TV appearance, correct?\n15         A. That's what it says, yes. These were\n16     all --\n17         Q. During this period of time --\n18         MR. SCOTT: Whoa. Let -- let him finish\n19     his answer.\n20         A. These are all scheduled appearances. I\n21     assume that I did them.

SCOTT: Well, wait a minute. Let him\n10     finish his questions [sic].\n11         A. It would depend very much on whether there\n12     was a particular trial because I would be the\n13     commentator on the trial, along with other lawyers.\n14     And there were some days when there were trials and\n15     some days when there weren't and I would be\n16     available because I was living in New York at the\n17     time.\n18      BY MR. SCAROLA:\n19         Q. On Tuesday, the 16th, there is an entry\n20     that says Epstein, right?\n21         A. On Tuesday, the 16th?\n22         Q. Yes, sir.\n23         A. Where are we?

Let's go to the next\n4      page. I've just focused on this period of time in\n5      January 2001 and on Friday, January 12 --\n6          A. So we're going back to Friday, January 12.\n7      Yeah.\n8          Q. Your wife is in Cambridge, correct?\n9          A. No, I don't think so. My wife was living\n10     in New York with me at the time. I don't see any\n11     record of her being in Cambridge.\n12         She was -- we were living together in\n13     New York at NYU downtown. I was a visiting scholar.\n14     Having been appointed by John Sexton of NYU to be a\n15     visiting scholar, we were there for the year. And\n16     my wife was with me during the year. Our daughter\n17     was in school in New York. She went to Little Red\n18     Schoolhouse in New York. And we had -- our life was\n19     in New York for a period of one year.\n20         Q. And on Friday, January 12, you had another\n21     massage, right?\n22         A. I don't see anything on my record that --\n23         Q. Massage, A.D.?\n24         A.
