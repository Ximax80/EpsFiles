You might\n7 just look at the dictionary and probably get a\n8 variety of definitions for it.\n9 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n10 Q. Well, what I'm concerned about,\n11 Mr. Dershowitz, is not a dictionary definition. I\n12 want to know what your understanding of rhetorical\n13 hyperbole is.\n14 And do you agree that pursuant to your\n15 understanding of rhetorical hyperbole, it is an\n16 exaggeration beyond the facts?\n17 MR. SCOTT: Objection, argumentative and\n18 compound, three questions.\n19 A. No --\n20 MR. SCOTT: You can answer.\n21 A. -- I would not agree with that definition.\n22 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n23 Q. Okay.

SCAROLA: I don't think that's\n11 necessary because your client has told us that\n12 he has a superb memory and one of the things I\n13 would like to know is what he's able to recall.\n14 If he needs to refresh his memory, the\n15 transcripts will be here in just a moment, but\n16 I don't want to delay going forward.\n17 MR. SCOTT: Do you need the transcript to\n18 refresh your memory?\n19 THE WITNESS: Well, I have no memory of\n20 what specifically I said on a particular day in\n21 a particular interview.\n22 MR. SCOTT: Since you have a copy in front\n23 of him, why don't you just show him your copy\n24 then? Read the -- ask your question and let\n25 him read it.\n\n186\n1 Q.

SCAROLA:\n7 Q. Because I didn't understand it, so I would\n8 like you to try to give us a direct response to that\n9 question if you're able to.\n10 A. I will repeat exactly what I said. A\n11 rhetorical means verbal and hyperbole means some\n12 exaggeration of the facts for political or other\n13 reasons, but generally it is truthful in a literal\n14 sense but perhaps -- it all depends on context.\n15 And if you tell me the context in which I\n16 used it, I will be happy to describe what I meant in\n17 that context.

Do you recall having been interviewed on\n6 CNN Tonight by Don Lemon in early January of 2015,\n7 where you spoke about matters that have become the\n8 subject of this litigation?\n9 A. Yes, I do.\n10 Q.
