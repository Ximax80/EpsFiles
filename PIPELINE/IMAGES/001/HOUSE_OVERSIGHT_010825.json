Okay. There are going to be -- I'm going to\n01:11:08   6   end up giving you nine reasons, each of which is\n01:11:11   7   complicated, so I just want to -- if -- if I don't\n01:11:13   8   want to be accused of -- of filibustering or anything,\n01:11:15   9   I just want you to know that you have asked a broad\n01:11:18  10   question that's going to require a broad and extended\n01:11:20  11   answer. It -- it --\n01:11:21  12         Q.   Answer the question.\n01:11:22  13         A.   Okay.

Yeah.\n01:11:30  18         Q.   -- please give me your best recollection of\n01:11:34  19   what the basis was, the factual basis that you had in\n01:11:37  20   mind. If the court said to you -- let me put it this\n01:11:40  21   way. If you went to court and Judge Marra said,\n01:11:43  22   Professor Cassell, what's your factual basis for this\n01:11:46  23   allegation? Tell me. What would you say?\n01:11:48  24         A.   Right.\n01:11:49  25         MS. MCCAWLEY: Wait. Outside the context of\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n62\n01:11:50   1   anything that's been communicated to you.\n01:11:53   2         MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. You have asked two\n01:11:55   3   different questions now, and I need to understand\n01:11:56   4   which question you are asking.\n01:11:58   5         The question that you posed before just now\n01:12:02   6   was: What was the reason for your including\n01:12:06   7   those allegations in this pleading?\n01:12:08   8         Now you have asked: What is the factual\n01:12:10   9   basis? And that's going back to questions that\n01:12:14  10   we have already covered, and we have, I think,\n01:12:17  11   exhausted the ability to respond to that question\n01:12:20  12   outside of privileged information.\n01:12:23  13         Do you want to go back to the question about:\n01:12:26  14   What was your reason for including those\n01:12:28  15   allegations?\n01:12:29  16         MR. SIMPSON: I'll ask the question a\n01:12:30  17   different way.\n01:12:31  18         MR. SCAROLA: Thank you.\n01:12:31  19   BY MR. SIMPSON:\n01:12:33  20         Q.   Mr. Cassell, I'm going to ask you: If you're\n01:12:37  21   in court and Judge Marra said to you, counsel, what is\n01:12:42  22   the factual basis for your allegation that Professor\n01:12:47  23   Dershowitz abused other minors, what would you say? And\n01:12:51  24   if you wouldn't say something because it was privileged,\n01:12:52  25   then don't include it. What would you tell the judge\n10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\nPage 61 to 64 of 151\n\n63\n01:12:55   1   was your basis for this?\n01:12:56   2         A.   All right. So the initial basis for it\n01:13:00   3   was --\n01:13:00   4         MR. SCAROLA: First of all, let me object\n01:13:02   5   because Professor Cassell is not here as an\n01:13:04   6   expert witness and hypotheticals are\n01:13:06   7   inappropriate. You're calling for speculation on\n01:13:08   8   his part. I'm not going to instruct him not to\n01:13:10   9   answer, but it is an improper question.\n01:13:14  10         MR. SIMPSON: I disagree, but you can answer\n01:13:14  11   the question.\n01:13:14  12         THE WITNESS: Right. So the -- the factual\n01:13:17  13   basis would -- we are setting aside\n01:13:21  14   attorney/client communications, right?\n01:13:21  15   BY MR. SIMPSON:\n01:13:22  16         Q.   I'm asking: What would you tell the judge?\n01:13:26  17         A.   Right. So that -- I -- I -- that's\n01:13:28  18   speculative to -- I don't think I can give a fair answer\n01:13:30  19   at this point because that would have involved going\n01:13:32  20   back to my client and -- and carving out what kinds\n01:13:36  21   of things we were going to present to Judge Marra in\n01:13:39  22   light of the posture of the case at that point.\n01:13:42  23         So it's a speculative question. I would\n01:13:46  24   have -- let me just -- without going into any\n01:13:48  25   attorney/client privileged communications, I would have\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n64\n01:13:51   1   provided an ample factual basis for those allegations.\n01:13:55   2         MR.

Let me ask it this way: We have talked\n01:14:00   6   about -- somewhat about the basis for this allegation\n01:14:02   7   about other minors. Putting aside information as to\n01:14:09   8   which you're claiming privilege, tell me what you knew\n01:14:13   9   as of December 30th, 2014, that formed the factual basis\n01:14:20  10   for your -- for that allegation about other minors.\n01:14:23  11         MR. SCAROLA: And I'll instruct you not to\n01:14:25  12   answer that question for the same reason, that\n01:14:27  13   when the same question was asked earlier, I\n01:14:29  14   instructed you not to answer.\n01:14:31  15         MR. SIMPSON: I'm -- I'm -- maybe we are not\n01:14:33  16   being clear, Jack. I'm asking him to put\n01:14:35  17   aside -- I mean, certainly, he -- he filed a\n01:14:37  18   pleading. You've asserted privilege as to\n01:14:40  19   certain aspects. I'm simply asking him, putting\n01:14:43  20   aside whatever you're claiming privilege for,\n01:14:45  21   right, so I'm not -- I'm not asking you right now\n01:14:47  22   to tell me anything you're claiming as\n01:14:49  23   privileged.\n01:14:49  24   BY MR.
