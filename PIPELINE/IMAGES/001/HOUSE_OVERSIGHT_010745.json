Approximately six years ago, Jane Doe #3 took\nadvantage of the NPA’s provisions, sued Mr. Epstein and received a monetary settlement.\nIronically, Jane Doe #3 now seeks to overturn the very NPA which required Epstein to waive his\nright to contest liability by moving to join the instant action which seeks to rescind that very\nagreement.\n\nYet, she apparently never once mentioned Prof. Dershowitz’s now supposedly systematic\nsexual abuse of her to the prosecutors or to her own lawyer.
