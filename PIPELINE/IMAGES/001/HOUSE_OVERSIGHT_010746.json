Prof. Dershowitz Immediately Responded to Jane Doe #3's Allegations\nAgainst Him by Asking to Defend his Reputation\n\nJane Doe #3 also argues that Prof. Dershowitz should not be allowed to intervene because\n\n“he has declined to defend his reputation in other actions.” (DE 279, at 12.) This is\n\ndemonstrably false. It is without question that the Motion for Joinder filed by Jane Doe #3 on\n\nDecember 30, 2014 (DE 279) was the first time anyone has ever alleged that Prof. Dershowitz\n\nhad any sexual contact with a minor.

This, too, is demonstrably false. Despite this rank and self-serving speculation about\n\nwhat Prof. Dershowitz “understood,” there is not one piece of evidence which points to any\n\nallegations that he engaged in any sexual contact with any minor, or even observed any criminal\n\nactivity, prior to the December 30, 2014 Motion for Joinder.
