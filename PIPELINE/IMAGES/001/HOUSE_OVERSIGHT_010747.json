As to whether any of those women were ever associated with Mr. Dershowitz would it\nbe a correct statement that you have absolutely no knowledge?\nA. I don’t know, sir.\n...\nQ. Okay.

No, sir.\n\n(Rodriguez Depo. Tr. at 279, 280, 385, 386.) To be sure, Rodriguez does testify that Prof.\n\nDershowitz was at Epstein’s home when young females were present at the home – an allegation\n\nwhich Dershowitz strenuously denies. However, Rodriguez did not testify that Prof. Dershowitz\n\nsaw, interacted with, or touched any of these females. Instead, when asked what Prof.\n\nDershowitz did “while those girls were at the house,” Rodriguez answered “He will read a book\n\nwith a glass of wine by the pool, stay inside.” (Id. at 426, 427.) When asked if Prof. Dershowitz\n\never even spoke to any of the girls, or “even knew that they were there” Rodriguez answered “I\n\ndon’t know.” (Id. at 427.) This is consistent with the fact that Epstein’s home is very large and\n\nhas separate closed-off quarters where Epstein resided. Prof. Dershowitz never stepped into\n\nthese private quarters.\n\nJane Doe #3 also relies upon the September 8, 2009 deposition testimony of Mr. Juan\n\nAlessi to “corroborate” Jane Doe #3’s sensational and false allegations regarding Prof.\n\nDershowitz. However, a more complete examination of that testimony reveals that Alessi did\n\nnot make any allegations of any wrong doing by Dershowitz.
