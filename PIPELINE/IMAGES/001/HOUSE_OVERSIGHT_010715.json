The woman, on the left, is wearing a light-colored, sequined gown and is holding an Oscar. She has her mouth open and is looking at the man. The man, in the center, is wearing a white tuxedo jacket and black bow tie, also holding an Oscar, and is looking down at his jacket. To the right is a large Oscar statuette on a pedestal. There are floral arrangements in the scene. The image has text overlaid at the bottom.",
