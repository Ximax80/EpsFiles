    "description": "A photograph of a modern, upscale interior living space. The room features light-colored walls, recessed ceiling lighting, and a light-colored rug with a dark grid pattern. There are several black leather armchairs and a large dark-framed sofa or daybed with white cushions. A large mirror or glass partition on the left reflects the room and a wooden parquet floor. Framed black and white artwork hangs on the walls. A tall, dark speaker is visible in the corner. The overall aesthetic is minimalist and contemporary.",
