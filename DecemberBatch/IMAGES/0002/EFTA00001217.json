On the left, there is a large sliding mirror door with a black industrial-style frame and exposed rollers. In the foreground, a grey armchair with a blue frame faces away from the camera. To the right, a colorful side table with a red top, yellow base, and blue accents holds a large lamp with a cream-colored shade. In the background, there is a dark sofa, another mirror, and framed artwork on the walls. The ceiling has several HVAC vents.",
