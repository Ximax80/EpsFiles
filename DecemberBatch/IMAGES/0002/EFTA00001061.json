On the left, there is a white salon-style chair and a pink patterned chair. A large, unique triangular chandelier hangs from the ceiling. In the background, a mirror reflects a bright light source (likely the camera flash) and a small white sign with the letter 'Q' is visible on a glass door. To the right, open shelving displays shoes.",
