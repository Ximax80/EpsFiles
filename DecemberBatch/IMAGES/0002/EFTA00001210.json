    "description": "A photograph of a long, narrow interior hallway. The hallway features off-white or cream-colored walls and a distinctive red carpet with a black geometric diamond pattern and black floral motifs. There are black stripes running along the edges of the carpet. On the right wall, there are several rectangular, frosted glass light fixtures and a recessed window or alcove area. At the end of the hallway is a closed white door with a handle and a door closer mechanism at the top. On the left, an open doorway reveals a glimpse of another room or area. The lighting appears artificial and somewhat dim towards the end of the corridor.",
