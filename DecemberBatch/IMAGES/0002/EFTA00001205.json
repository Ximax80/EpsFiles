    "description": "A photograph showing a cluttered storage room or closet. In the foreground, there are large white boxes and rolls of paper, including one labeled 'AS BUILT'. In the center, there is a large blue trunk with red 'fragile' glass icons and upward-pointing arrows, stacked on top of a silver/grey trunk with metal latches. A white canvas-like material is draped over the blue trunk. In the background, there are white walls with built-in panels or cabinets, one of which has a small black handle or latch. A white door is visible on the right side. The lighting is artificial and appears to be from a flash, creating shadows.",
