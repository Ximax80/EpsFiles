The walls are painted an off-white or light beige color. On the wall at the landing, there are two framed pictures with black frames and white matting. Above the pictures is a circular, glowing wall-mounted light fixture. To the right of the landing, there is a curved wall section. A white electrical outlet is visible on the lower wall near the landing corner.",
