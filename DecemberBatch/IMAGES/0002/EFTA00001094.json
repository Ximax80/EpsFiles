    "description": "An interior photograph of a highly decorated room. The walls feature a light-colored wallpaper with large, hand-painted blue floral and leaf motifs. The floor is covered with a cream-colored carpet featuring a bold, dark blue grid pattern. To the left, there is a wicker armchair with blue and white striped cushions. To the right, a curved, white textured sofa is visible with decorative blue and white throw pillows. A white paneled door is partially open, revealing another room with similar blue floral wallpaper, a dark pedestal with a large vessel, and a patterned bench. A blue and white chevron-patterned curtain is visible on the far left.",
