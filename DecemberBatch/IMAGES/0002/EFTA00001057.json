The wallpaper features a repeating damask-style or paisley-like motif in shades of blue, red, and gold. To the left is a thick, light-colored wooden door frame leading into another room where a white door is partially visible. On the right side of the wall, a white piece of paper with a large letter 'P' is taped or affixed. The floor is carpeted in a light neutral color, and there is a light wood baseboard running along the bottom of the wall.",
