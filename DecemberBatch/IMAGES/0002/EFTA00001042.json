    "description": "A photograph of a desk setup in what appears to be a home office or study. The central focus is a large Apple iMac computer with a black screen. To the left of the computer is a blue picture frame containing a photo (partially redacted with a black box), a small white electronic device, and several small decorative boxes. To the right is a black multi-line office telephone (Starplus Digital), a white piece of paper or card, and a yellow cleaning cloth next to a spray bottle with a red nozzle. The desk is made of dark, polished wood. In the background, there is a lamp with a pleated shade and ornate furniture.",
