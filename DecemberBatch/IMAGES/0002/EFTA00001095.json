The floor is covered with a bright blue carpet featuring a dark border. A white protective cloth or tarp is partially covering the carpet in the foreground. There are several doorways visible leading into further rooms or corridors. A gold-framed mirror or picture frame is mounted on the left wall, with its center blacked out. Ornate, lantern-style light fixtures hang from the ceiling.",
