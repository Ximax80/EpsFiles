The walls are covered in a light blue damask-patterned wallpaper. There is dark wood paneling along the base of the walls and a dark wood handrail with metal balusters. A gold-colored ornate candelabra-style wall sconce with six electric candle bulbs is mounted on the right wall, and a portion of another is visible on the left.",
