    "description": "A high-angle, downward-looking photograph of a spiral staircase inside a building with ornate wood paneling. The stairs are covered in blue carpeting with dark stripes. The railing features brass-colored balusters and a wooden handrail. A large, ornate brass light fixture or decorative element is visible in the foreground, partially covered by a light blue cloth or ribbon. In the background, there is a built-in wooden cabinet with glass doors reflecting the room and showing books on shelves. A blue glass sphere sits atop a post on the left. The lighting is somewhat harsh, creating strong shadows on the wood paneling.",
