    "description": "A photograph of a well-organized walk-in closet. The image shows several white shelves and drawers. The top shelves hold white storage bins and folded items. Below them, a hanging rod holds several white shirts on hangers. A white countertop area has a blue shopping bag from 'skinkruter' and a white shopping bag. Below the counter are glass-fronted drawers containing folded clothing like shirts and jeans. To the right, a wooden belt rack is mounted on the wall with several belts hanging from it. In the background, a glimpse of another room with a lamp and vanity is visible.",
