    "description": "A photograph showing an interior construction or renovation site. The room is filled with blue metal scaffolding. The walls and ceiling are covered in translucent plastic sheeting. The floor is covered with brown protective paper or boards, taped together at the seams. In the foreground, there is a collection of construction equipment, including a Festool brand dust extractor (vacuum), cardboard boxes containing supplies like containers and tape, and some white cloths or rags. A white cross-brace from the scaffolding dominates the center of the frame. The lighting is artificial, with a single bright light source visible in the background.",
