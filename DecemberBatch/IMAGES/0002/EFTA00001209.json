    "description": "A photograph of a basement or utility room. The room contains four tall, cream-colored metal lockers or storage cabinets against a wall. In the foreground, there is a large, white-painted horizontal duct or structural element with a beige multi-line office telephone sitting on top of it. Above the lockers, there are various pipes, conduits, and a large industrial light fixture hanging from the ceiling. To the left, there are vertical white pipes and some dark, thin objects leaning against the wall. To the right, a vertical metal pipe is prominent in the foreground. The floor appears to be a light-colored concrete or tile.",
