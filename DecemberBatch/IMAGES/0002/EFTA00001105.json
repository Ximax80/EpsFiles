    "description": "A photograph of a bedroom interior. The room features bright pink walls and a white patterned carpet. A large bed with white linens and a dark green velvet headboard is the central focus. Two decorative pillows with intricate patterns are on the bed. At the foot of the bed are two matching green upholstered footstools with dark wood bases. To the left of the bed is a nightstand covered with a patterned cloth, holding a lamp with a pleated shade and a black trim. Behind the bed, the wall is pink, and to the left, there is a window with white sheer curtains and colorful striped drapes. A small portion of a decorative cabinet is visible on the far left edge.",
