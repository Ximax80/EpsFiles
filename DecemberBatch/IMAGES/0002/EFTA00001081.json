    "description": "A photograph of the interior of a small, narrow closet. The closet contains a top shelf with folded colorful fabrics, a dark hat, and a gold-colored ornate crown or headdress. Below the shelf is a brass hanging rod with various garments on wooden hangers, including long black robes, white garments (one with a red stripe on the sleeve), and a white fringed shawl. On the floor of the closet are several pairs of shoes, including traditional woven bast shoes (lapti), tall white felt boots (valenki) with red embroidery, and dark leather shoes. A brown bag or case is also visible on the floor. The closet is flanked by white door frames, and a mirror on the right door reflects the interior.",
