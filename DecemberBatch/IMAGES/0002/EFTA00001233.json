    "description": "A close-up photograph of a grand staircase interior. The stairs are covered in a vibrant blue carpet with three parallel black stripes running along the left side. The banister is made of dark wood with ornate brass or gold-toned metal balusters and structural posts. A prominent feature is a large, dark blue glass orb with gold-flecked inclusions sitting atop a brass pedestal on the main newel post. In the background, a blue fabric cord or rope hangs vertically. The lighting is sharp, likely from a camera flash, creating strong shadows against the dark wood paneling in the background.",
