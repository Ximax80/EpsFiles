    "description": "A photograph of an industrial or utility room, likely a basement or mechanical space. The image shows a large HVAC unit or air handling system with metal ductwork. To the left, there is a black filing cabinet with several yellow sticky notes attached to the drawers. On top of the cabinet is a red plastic milk crate containing papers and what appears to be a rolled-up document. A metal ladder or shelving frame is visible in the background. The floor is concrete, and there is a grey bucket on the floor near the machinery. A large, teardrop-shaped metal cover with a yellow paint splash or marking stands on the floor in front of the HVAC unit.",
    "layout": "The photograph is taken from a standing perspective, looking into a cluttered utility space. The filing cabinet is in the foreground left, and the mechanical equipment dominates the center and background.",
