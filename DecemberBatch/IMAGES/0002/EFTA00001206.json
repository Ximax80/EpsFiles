    "description": "A photograph showing a large-format document storage rack. The rack contains multiple vertical hanging clamps holding large sheets of paper, many of which appear to be architectural or engineering blueprints. Several rolls of paper are resting horizontally across the top of the rack. The papers appear aged, yellowed, and some are torn or damaged. A white label with a barcode is visible on the side of a box or folder on the right. The background shows a plain wall and a door handle.",
