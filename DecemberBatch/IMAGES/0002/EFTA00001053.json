The room features dark patterned wallpaper, a large wooden cabinet filled with various bottles and containers (resembling an apothecary or vanity), a small wooden side table with a white telephone and papers, and two speakers (one silver/black tower and one black monitor on a stand). A large, dark painting is visible in the foreground on the right, partially obscuring the view. The ceiling has a painted sky/cloud mural. The floor is covered with a light-colored patterned carpet.",
