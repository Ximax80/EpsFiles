    "description": "A photograph taken through an open doorway looking into a room. The room appears to be a dressing room or a high-end salon space. Inside, there are two chairs: one white and one with a pink and white striped pattern. A patterned rug covers the floor. In the background, there are mirrored doors or panels and another chair. Two ornate, triangular-shaped chandeliers with candle-style bulbs hang from the ceiling. The doorway in the foreground has a cream-colored frame with decorative molding and a dark rectangular plate (possibly a light switch or door hardware) on the left side.",
