    "description": "An interior photograph of a staircase and wall. The upper wall is covered in blue patterned wallpaper with a floral or damask-style vertical stripe. A wooden chair rail or molding separates the blue wallpaper from dark wood paneling below. A wooden handrail with metal balusters is visible in the foreground, looking down into a stairwell. A wall-mounted candelabra-style light fixture with five electric 'candle' bulbs is attached to the blue wall. A thin, blue vertical cord or ribbon hangs from the ceiling down past the light fixture towards the bottom of the frame. A dark shadow of the cord is cast on the wall. At the very bottom, a blue decorative orb or finial is visible on a post.",
