The tiger is posed in a resting position with its head turned slightly to the left. In the background, there is a dark wood table with intricate carvings and turned legs, and light-colored, floor-length curtains. To the left, a portion of a blue upholstered chair with a gold-colored frame and a tassel is visible. The flooring appears to be dark wood parquet.",
