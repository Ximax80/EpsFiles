In the foreground, there is a modern white salon chair with black armrests positioned on a black mat. Behind it is a pink patterned chair. To the right is a built-in vanity or desk with drawers, a large mirror, a lamp with a pleated shade, and various personal items including a framed photo and a small box. In the background, an open doorway leads to a hallway where a person's silhouette is visible. The room features ornate molding and a chandelier.",
