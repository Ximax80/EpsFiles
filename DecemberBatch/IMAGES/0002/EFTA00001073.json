    "description": "A photograph showing the interior of a construction or renovation site. Blue metal scaffolding frames dominate the foreground and middle ground, set up on a floor covered with brown protective paper and white plastic sheeting. The walls are draped in translucent plastic sheeting. In the lower right, there are various construction-related items including a cardboard box labeled '3.785mL 4-1 GALLON', white plastic bags, and what appears to be a black tray or tool component. The lighting is bright, likely from an on-camera flash, creating harsh shadows.",
