    "description": "A photograph of a luxurious walk-in closet or dressing room. The room features ornate, cream-colored double doors with decorative carvings along the edges. In the center of the room is a long, tufted brown leather bench with ornate claw-foot legs. A chandelier with candle-style bulbs hangs from the ceiling. In the background, dark blue curtains cover a window or doorway, and a small table with a suitcase or briefcase sits in front of them. On the left door frame, a white paper sign with a large black 'S' is taped.",
