On the wall behind the door, there is a wall-mounted light fixture, two fire extinguishers, and a white rectangular box. Further down the hallway, there is a recessed glass-fronted cabinet containing what appears to be a white garment or cloth. To the right, a staircase with a wooden handrail and blue spindles leads downwards. The floor is covered in a dark, patterned carpet.",
