    "description": "A photograph of an interior room featuring a large, framed mural or painting on a pink wall. The painting depicts several figures in a classical or mythological style, including a central standing child-like figure, a seated figure looking into a mirror, and a reclining figure. Several white birds (doves) are depicted in flight within the painting. The room has a light-colored patterned carpet, a small wooden side table with books and a lamp with a green and red diamond-patterned shade, and a portion of a floral-patterned chair is visible in the bottom right corner. An air conditioning vent is visible in the ceiling above the painting.",
