To the right is a blue-painted wooden banister with a natural wood handrail. On the landing wall, there are two framed black and white photographs: one smaller square frame and one larger rectangular frame depicting a canal scene (likely Venice). Above the larger frame is a circular, glowing wall-mounted light fixture. The walls are a neutral off-white or light grey color.",
