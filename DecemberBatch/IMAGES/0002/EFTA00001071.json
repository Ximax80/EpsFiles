The bust sits on a pedestal in a corner with light-colored stone block walls. In the foreground, a large, pleated, light-colored lampshade with visible stitching along the edges is partially visible. The scene appears to be an interior space, possibly a basement or storage area, as plastic sheeting is visible in the lower right corner.",
