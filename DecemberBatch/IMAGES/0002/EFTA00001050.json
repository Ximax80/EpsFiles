The floor is carpeted in a light tan or beige color. At the end of the hallway, there is a dark room or alcove with heavy burgundy/dark red curtains. In front of the curtains stands a white medical-style examination lamp on a wheeled base. The doorframe in the foreground is made of light-colored wood with decorative molding. A white door is partially visible on the left side of the frame.",
