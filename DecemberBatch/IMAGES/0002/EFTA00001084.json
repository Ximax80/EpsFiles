    "description": "An interior photograph of a hallway or small room. The walls are covered in a light-colored wallpaper featuring large, blue floral patterns (possibly peonies or poppies) and blue butterflies. To the left is an open doorway leading into another room with white doors and a blue rug on the floor. On the right, there is a gray upholstered bench or sofa with a metallic frame and a gold-colored pillow. In front of the bench sits a small wooden stump stool, a framed black-and-white photograph leaning against the wall, and a white decorative object on a stand. A shell-shaped wall sconce provides warm lighting from above. A small white card with a large letter 'U' is taped to the wall near a light switch.",
