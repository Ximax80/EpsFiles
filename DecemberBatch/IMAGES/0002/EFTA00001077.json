    "description": "A photograph showing an interior doorway or passage. In the foreground, a cream-colored door with a brass knob and keyhole is partially open on the right side. The doorway leads into a narrow corridor with light-colored stone or masonry walls. Further down the corridor, another door is partially open, revealing a glimpse of a room with a dark chandelier and what appears to be a striped wall or curtain. The floor in the foreground is covered with a brown protective material, possibly paper or cardboard, and some plastic sheeting is visible at the bottom left. A dark blue mat or piece of material is on the floor in the middle ground.",
