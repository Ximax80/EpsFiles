    "description": "A photograph of a large, multi-panel Japanese-style landscape painting (byōbu) mounted on a light-colored stone or tile wall. The painting depicts a misty mountain scene with rocky outcroppings, pine trees, and small boats on a body of water in the foreground. The artwork is framed and suspended by a black hanging system with rods and wires. The wall consists of rectangular stone blocks. A portion of a handrail is visible in the bottom right corner, suggesting the photo was taken from a staircase.",
