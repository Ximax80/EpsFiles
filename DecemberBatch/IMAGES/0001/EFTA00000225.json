In the foreground, a light-colored door is partially open, featuring a white label with a large black letter 'W' taped to its center panel. Behind it, another door is open, revealing a glimpse into a dimly lit room with patterned carpet, a piece of furniture (possibly a bench or ottoman), and heavy curtains in the background. A gold-toned hinge is visible on the leftmost door frame.",
