    "description": "A photograph of a bathroom vanity area. The scene features a pink marble countertop with an oval white under-mount sink. On the counter are various toiletries including toothpaste, a toothbrush in a cup, a white soap dispenser, and a red tube of Darphin product. A white hand towel is folded on the counter. The wall is covered in vertical striped wallpaper with colors of pink, yellow, and cream. A large black-framed mirror is mounted on the left wall, reflecting a door. To the right of the mirror is an ornate black wall sconce with two small lampshades featuring a green floral pattern. A white light switch is visible on the right wall above a silver towel bar. The vanity cabinet is off-white with small silver knobs.",
