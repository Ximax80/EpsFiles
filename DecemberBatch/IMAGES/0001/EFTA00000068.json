Surrounding the table are several chairs upholstered in a leopard-print fabric. The walls are decorated with a mural depicting stylized clouds or mountains. There are two large windows with heavy, cream-colored drapes. On the far wall, there is a dark wood sideboard or buffet holding numerous framed photographs and a small gong. A candelabra is visible on the left, and a vase of flowers sits on the table.",
