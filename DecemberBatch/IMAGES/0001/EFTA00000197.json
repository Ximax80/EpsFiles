On the left, a black-framed artwork is partially visible, and a towel rack holds two white towels. In the center, a small alcove contains a dark marble countertop with a sink and white cabinetry below. A small framed photograph of a person reclining is mounted on the wall above the counter, next to a brass wall sconce with a frosted glass shade.
