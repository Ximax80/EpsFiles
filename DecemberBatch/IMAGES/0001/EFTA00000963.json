    "description": "A close-up photograph of a stainless steel dumbwaiter or small service elevator built into a white-painted wall. To the left of the metal door is a vertical control panel with several buttons and indicator lights. The dumbwaiter door is split horizontally, appearing to be a bi-parting or slide-up style door. There is a small circular peephole or handle in the upper section. At the bottom right, a portion of a metal cart or bin is visible.",
