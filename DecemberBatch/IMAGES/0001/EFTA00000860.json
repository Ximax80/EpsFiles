    "description": "A photograph taken from a doorway or hallway looking into a room. The central focus is a large oil painting hanging on a neutral-colored wall. The painting depicts a woman with blonde hair wearing a blue dress, seated in a chair. To the left of the painting is an open door with a white paper or label attached to it. The walls flanking the doorway appear to be made of light-colored stone or textured panels. A small white device, possibly a thermostat or sensor, is visible on the left wall. A small framed object is partially visible on the right wall.",
