The doorway reveals a room with beige walls and dark, pinstriped carpeting. On the wall directly facing the doorway hangs a large painting of a woman in a blue dress sitting in a chair. A white baseboard and an electrical outlet are visible at the bottom of the wall. The door itself is open, showing hinges and a handle.",
