    "description": "A photograph of a long, narrow interior hallway. The hallway features a red patterned carpet with black borders and circular motifs. The walls are painted an off-white or light beige color. On the right wall, there are three rectangular, wall-mounted light fixtures that are illuminated, casting a warm glow. There are also recessed window or alcove areas on the right. At the end of the hallway is a closed white door. On the left side, there is a doorway leading into another room. A broom or similar cleaning tool is leaning against the wall near the door at the end of the hall.",
