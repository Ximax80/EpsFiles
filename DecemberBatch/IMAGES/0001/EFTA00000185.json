    "description": "A photograph of a long, narrow walk-in closet or dressing room. The room features rows of cream-colored paneled wardrobes with ornate handles and small crest-like emblems on both sides. In the center of the room is a long, tufted reddish-brown leather bench with an ornate dark metal or wood base. At the far end of the hallway, there are deep blue velvet curtains covering a window or doorway. In front of the curtains sits a small wooden stand holding what appears to be a briefcase or luggage. A decorative rectangular chandelier with fringe hangs from the ceiling.",
