    "description": "A high-quality interior photograph of a luxurious dressing room or vanity area. The room features ornate, cream-colored wood paneling with decorative carvings. A large built-in vanity desk with drawers is centered, topped with a large mirror that reflects a chandelier and the opposite side of the room. On the vanity, there are various items including makeup brushes, bottles, a small statue, and lamps. A modern white salon-style chair with a black base is positioned in front of the vanity. To the right, an open doorway leads to another room with similar decor.",
