    "description": "A photograph of a small office or workspace corner. The room has beige walls and grey carpet. On the left, a white door is partially visible. Next to it stands a large silver ribbed suitcase with a yellow sticky note on it. In the center, there is a small white desk with a white modern office chair. On the desk are several electronic devices, including what appear to be multiple cordless phone handsets in a charging base, a calculator, and some rolled-up papers. Above the desk, a white wall-mounted mail organizer labeled 'MAIL' holds several envelopes. To the right of the mail organizer is a digital wall clock displaying '6:02'. On the far right, another white door frame is visible.",
