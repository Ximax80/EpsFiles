The room features a bed with white linens in the foreground, a dark wood desk with a white lamp and various items on it, two orange chairs, a white armchair with a pet bed on it, and a dark dresser with a large flat-screen television. A doorway is visible on the left side of the frame, showing a glimpse of another room with yellow carpeting. A green and grey patterned tube (possibly a pet tunnel) is on the floor under the desk. The walls are a light cream color with crown molding.",
