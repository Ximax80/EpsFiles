Underneath the curve of the stairs is a seating area with three plush, cream-colored armchairs arranged around a small table with a chessboard. In the background, a long dark console table holds several decorative items, including two white stylized bust sculptures and a dark circular object. The floor is light-colored stone or tile with dark diamond-shaped accents. The walls are white with gold-trimmed architectural molding near the ceiling and doorframes.",
