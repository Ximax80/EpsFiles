    "description": "A photograph of a storage room or closet area. The room has beige walls and grey carpeting. On the left, there is an open white door leading to another space, and a closed white door next to it. On the right wall, there are white adjustable shelving tracks with two white shelves installed. On the shelves, there are several items: a stack of black rectangular objects, a white plastic shopping bag with orange text, and a white paper package with blue lettering. Below the shelves, there is a large open cardboard box with clear plastic wrapping inside, a rolled-up tan rug or mat leaning against the wall, and a white plastic bucket on the floor. A green bubble-wrapped item is visible on a partial shelf on the far right.",
