    "description": "An interior photograph of a room featuring a large mirrored wall composed of multiple antiqued or foxed glass panels. In front of the mirror is a low wooden bookshelf filled with various books. To the right of the bookshelf is a wingback armchair upholstered in a leopard-print fabric. On top of the bookshelf, reflected in the mirror, are several objects including a blue and white ceramic figurine (possibly a seated figure) and a sculpture of a reclining animal (possibly a dog or deer). The floor is a dark wood parquet in a basketweave or chevron-like pattern. The ceiling and door frame visible on the right are white with ornate gold leaf detailing.",
