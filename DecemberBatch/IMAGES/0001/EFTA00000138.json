The foreground shows a marble-topped vanity with gold-toned fixtures, a sink, and various toiletries including a bottle of Listerine and a tube of toothpaste. On the vanity sits a dark sculpture of a winged figure. To the left is a hallway with parquet wood flooring, a patterned bench, and a large framed mirror leaning against the wall. A telephone is visible on a small stand next to the bench. Through an open doorway, a toilet is visible in a separate room, and a framed black-and-white artwork hangs on the far wall. The walls are decorated with ornate wood paneling and patterned wallpaper.",
