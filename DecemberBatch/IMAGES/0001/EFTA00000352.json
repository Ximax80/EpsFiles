    "description": "A photograph showing an industrial mechanical room or HVAC space. The scene contains large air handling units (AHUs), extensive ductwork, and a complex network of insulated piping. Several pipes are labeled with yellow 'HEATING WATER SUP.' and 'HEATING WATER RET.' stickers. There is a wooden sawhorse and a metal ladder frame on the floor. The lighting is artificial and harsh, casting deep shadows.",
