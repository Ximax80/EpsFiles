Beneath the staircase is a seating area with four white, plush, textured armchairs arranged around a small round table with a chessboard on top. In the background, there is a dark sideboard or console table holding several decorative objects, including two white stylized head sculptures and a dark circular platter. The floor is light-colored stone or marble with dark diamond-shaped tile accents. The walls are white with gold-leaf molding near the ceiling and doorframes.",
