The room features wood-paneled walls with a chevron pattern, a dark blue ceiling, and a large ornate chandelier. Furniture includes a white sofa with patterned pillows, two pink upholstered armchairs, and a large, rounded orange lounge chair. A dark wood coffee table sits in the center on a large oriental-style rug. In the background, there are tall white curtains, a large antique cabinet (secretary desk), and bookshelves. Several lamps with pleated shades are visible, along with decorative objects like mirrors, a bust, and stacks of books.",
