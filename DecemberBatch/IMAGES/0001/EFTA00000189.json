    "description": "A high-angle photograph of a small bathroom or bidet area. The scene features a white porcelain bidet with three dark metal faucets. To the left is a toilet paper holder with two rolls of white toilet paper. To the right, a white landline telephone sits on a small, ornate gold-toned circular table. Above the bidet, a framed photograph of a fluffy white cat is mounted on the wall, and above that is a wall-mounted light fixture. The walls are a light beige/cream color with decorative molding. A small bottle of soap or lotion is placed on the back ledge of the bidet.",
