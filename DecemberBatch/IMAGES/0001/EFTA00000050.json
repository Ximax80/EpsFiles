    "description": "A photograph of an interior hallway or alcove. The walls are covered in a patterned, textured wallpaper with horizontal bands and diamond motifs. Three framed artworks are hung vertically on the wall. Below them sits a small, dark wood side table with thin legs. On top of the table are two books and a light-colored, irregularly shaped object (possibly a stone or piece of coral). To the right, a portion of a large, ornate gold-gilded mirror frame is visible. The floor appears to be carpeted or tiled in a neutral tone.",
