    "description": "A photograph of a bedroom interior. The walls are painted a vibrant purple. A dark wood dresser sits against the wall, topped with a large gold-framed mirror, a flat-screen television, a small stuffed animal (lion), a tissue box, and some plastic-wrapped items. To the left of the dresser is a black wooden chair. To the right, white curtains with thin blue vertical stripes frame a window. An air conditioning unit is visible in the window. In the foreground, a bed with a black, white, and grey striped faux-fur throw is partially visible. A white air purifier or heater is on the floor near the curtains.",
