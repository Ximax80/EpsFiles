    "description": "A high-resolution photograph of a lavishly decorated room, likely a study or library. The room features wood-paneled walls with a herringbone pattern, ornate antique cabinets (bargueños) with gold detailing, and a large patterned Persian-style rug. In the center is a modern, geometric gold-colored coffee table holding several stacks of books and a decorative glass sphere. A taxidermy tiger is positioned on the floor near white floor-to-ceiling curtains. To the left, a blue patterned ottoman is visible, and a white sofa sits behind the coffee table.",
