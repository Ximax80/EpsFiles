The foreground shows white walls and a door frame with gold trim. The interior room features a dark marble vanity with a thin metal frame, two wall-mounted sconces, a large mirror, and a patterned wallpaper. Further back, another doorway reveals a second area with a large ornate gold-framed mirror and a toilet. The flooring appears to be dark polished stone with a small tan rug in the center.",
