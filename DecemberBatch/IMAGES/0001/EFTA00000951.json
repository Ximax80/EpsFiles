    "description": "An interior shot of a room, likely a dining or meeting room. In the foreground is a white table covered with a floral-patterned cloth and some items. Two chairs with leopard-print upholstery are visible. Against the back wall is a long, dark wood sideboard or console table crowded with numerous framed photographs. Above the sideboard, the wall features a mural or wallpaper with a stylized mountain or cloud pattern. To the left, there is a large gong on a wooden stand and a tall candelabra. Two doorways are visible: one open doorway leading to a kitchen or pantry area, and another open doorway on the right leading to a hallway with a white door. The room has striped carpeting.",
