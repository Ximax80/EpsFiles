    "description": "A photograph of an office or security monitoring room. The foreground features a white L-shaped desk with a mesh-backed office chair. On the desk are various items including a telephone, a calculator, a box of tissues, a roll of paper towels, and several pens/markers. Behind the desk is a large wall-mounted array of six monitors (four large screens on top, two smaller ones below). To the right, an open doorway leads to another room where a silver suitcase, a desk, another chair, and a digital clock showing '7:34' are visible. A second doorway with a sign labeled 'A' is visible in the background center.",
