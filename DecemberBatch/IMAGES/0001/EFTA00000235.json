    "description": "A photograph of an interior room, likely a bedroom or sitting area. The walls are painted a vibrant pink with white crown molding and baseboards. On the right wall, there is a large, framed mural or tapestry depicting a classical or mythological scene with several figures, including a central nude figure and others in various poses. To the right of the mural is a lamp with a green and red patterned shade. In the foreground, there is a chaise longue with a floral pattern and striped pillows (red, green, and white). On the left, an open doorway leads to another room, possibly a walk-in closet, where clothing is visible. The floor is covered in a light-colored, patterned carpet.",
