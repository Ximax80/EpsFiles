    "description": "A photograph of a mechanical utility or HVAC room. The foreground features a large blue industrial blower or fan unit labeled 'EF-3'. This unit is connected to a vertical white duct or column via a green flexible connector. To the left, there is a large, vertical galvanized metal duct. In the background, there are several white lockers or storage cabinets against a wall, and a window with dark bars. Various pipes and conduits run along the ceiling and walls. The lighting is artificial and appears to be from overhead fluorescent fixtures.",
