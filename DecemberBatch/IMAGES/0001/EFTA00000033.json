To the left, a tall black sculpture sits on a stone pedestal. To the right, a modern metal desk holds an Apple iMac computer, a telephone, a desk lamp, and various office supplies. In the foreground, a coffee table is covered with several books and a bowl of colorful items (possibly candy or small objects). A guitar is mounted on the wall behind the desk. A large white drum-style pendant lamp hangs over the desk area.",
