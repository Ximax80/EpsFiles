    "description": "A photograph of an interior hallway or foyer. The space features blue patterned carpeting with black border stripes. On the left wall is a large painting depicting a figure and what appears to be construction equipment (a blue ladder and orange barrier). In the center, a life-sized replica of a Chinese Terracotta Warrior statue stands against a beige wall. Several open doorways lead to further rooms, including one that appears to be a bedroom or dressing area with a white medical-style lamp and a small white tag with the letter 'P' attached to a doorframe. To the right is a white door with a circular window and an elevator call button panel.",
