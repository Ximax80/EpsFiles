On the left wall, there are several gray electrical boxes, conduits, and a four-outlet orange power receptacle. A framed document is mounted on the wall near more electrical panels. In the center, an open white door leads to a hallway with patterned flooring. Above, there are large metal air ducts and several white insulated pipes running across the ceiling. A white wall-mounted telephone is visible near the door frame.",
