    "description": "A high-angle photograph looking down a carpeted staircase. The stairs are covered in a dark grey, textured carpet with a grid-like pattern. To the right is a blue-painted metal railing with a light-colored wooden handrail. The walls are a neutral off-white or light beige. In the bottom left corner, a portion of a green and blue Swiffer product box is visible. The lighting appears to be from an overhead source or a camera flash, creating shadows on the walls.",
