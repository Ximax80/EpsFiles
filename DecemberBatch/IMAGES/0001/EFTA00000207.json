    "description": "A high-angle photograph of a lavishly decorated room. The walls are covered in a light gray wallpaper featuring large, vibrant blue floral patterns. On the left wall hangs a large, gold-framed painting of a woman reclining on a red sofa. Below the painting is a long, blue mirrored table holding a blue lamp and a small blue decorative object. In the center, a tall white fluted pedestal supports a large, light-colored stone urn. To the right of the pedestal is a pale yellow door standing slightly ajar, revealing another room with a glass-paneled door. The floor is covered in a cream-colored carpet with a bold blue grid pattern. On the right side of the room, there is a gray sofa and two small wooden stump-like side tables, one of which holds a small stone bust. A framed black and white photograph sits on the floor near the wall.",
