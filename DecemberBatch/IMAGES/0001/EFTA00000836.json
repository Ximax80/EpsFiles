The doors feature rectangular panels and a diamond-patterned parquet design at the bottom. Above the doors is a semi-circular transom window with a circular pane in the center. A lit, vintage-style lantern hangs from the archway. To the right of the door, there is a small intercom or doorbell panel and a brass plaque. The ground in front is a stone step.",
