    "description": "A photograph of a doorway or hallway within a residence. In the foreground, a white evidence marker with a large black letter 'P' is taped to a doorframe. The marker contains a grid for data entry, though the details are too small to read clearly. To the left, an open door reveals a dark room containing what appears to be a medical or specialized lamp on a stand. To the right, a framed picture hangs on a tan wall. The lighting is dim, likely from a camera flash.",
