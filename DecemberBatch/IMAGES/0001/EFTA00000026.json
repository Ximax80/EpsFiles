    "description": "A photograph of a small office space or nook. The room features a white desk with a white modern office chair. On the desk are several electronic devices including what appear to be cordless phone handsets in a charging base and a small silver electronic unit. Above the desk, a white wall-mounted mail organizer contains several envelopes and papers. To the left of the desk is a silver ribbed suitcase with a yellow sticky note on it, a wire mesh trash can, and a closed white door. To the right, an open door reveals a closet containing a FedEx Large box (labeled 139751) and shelves holding white packing peanuts and other supplies. The floor is covered in a grey pinstriped carpet.",
