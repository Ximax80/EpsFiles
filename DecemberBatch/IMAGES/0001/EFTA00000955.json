In the foreground, there is a dark-topped kitchen island or counter with three white, modern bar stools with chrome bases. To the left, a portion of a kitchen is visible, featuring a large, ornate black metal chandelier with candle-style lights and a stainless steel refrigerator. A long hallway with hardwood floors leads into the background, showing several doorways. A white wall in the center has a small piece of paper taped to it with a large letter 'G'. The photo is framed on the right by a dark wood door frame.",
