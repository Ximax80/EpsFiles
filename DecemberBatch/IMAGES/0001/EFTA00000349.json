    "description": "A photograph of an industrial or mechanical room, likely a basement or utility space. The image features large blue industrial fans or blowers labeled 'EF-1'. White insulated pipes run across the ceiling. One pipe has a yellow label that reads 'HEATING WATER SUP'. There is a white rectangular duct structure in the foreground with rolls of material (possibly insulation or floor mats) resting on top. A black multi-drawer cabinet is visible against the back wall. A wooden stand or easel is on the right side of the frame.",
