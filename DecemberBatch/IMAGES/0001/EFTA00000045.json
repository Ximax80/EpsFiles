A white piece of paper with a large black letter 'C' is taped to the door. Through the doorway, a hallway is visible with patterned wallpaper, two framed pictures on the wall, and a purple upholstered bench or settee. Another doorway is visible further down the hall. The lighting is somewhat dim, suggesting an indoor setting with flash or artificial light.",
