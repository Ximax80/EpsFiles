The lower portion of the unit consists of a cabinet with two doors swung open, revealing plastic storage bins filled with what appear to be documents, folders, and possibly media (like floppy disks or zip disks). One bin is inside the cabinet, and another is on the floor in front of it. There are also two framed photographs on the middle shelf.",
