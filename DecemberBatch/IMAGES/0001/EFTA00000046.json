    "description": "A photograph taken from a doorway looking into a luxurious bathroom or powder room. The room features a marble-topped vanity with a gold-toned metal frame, a large mirror, and two wall sconces. To the left, a doorway leads to another area where a toilet and a large gold-framed mirror are visible. The walls are covered in a patterned wallpaper. On the vanity, there is a sink, a soap dispenser, a box of tissues, and a dark sculptural bust. A tan rug is on the floor. The foreground shows a white door frame and a partially visible white door with a dark rectangular plate and a latch.",
