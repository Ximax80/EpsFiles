Above the rod are three white storage cubbies with glass or plastic fronts containing folded items. Below the hanging clothes, several pairs of shoes are visible on the floor. The jackets include a dark blue jacket with military-style patches (including an American flag and a 'Screaming Eagle' 101st Airborne patch), a bright yellow/green rain jacket, an orange and tan hunting-style jacket, an olive green jacket, a dark blue windbreaker, and denim jackets.",
