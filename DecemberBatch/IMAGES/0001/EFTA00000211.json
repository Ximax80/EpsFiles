    "description": "A high-angle, wide-shot photograph of a luxuriously decorated bedroom. The room features light blue and white floral wallpaper, a blue and white grid-patterned carpet, and a large, ornate blue glass chandelier hanging from the center of the ceiling. In the foreground, there is a large circular white upholstered swivel chair. To the left, there are two wicker chairs with blue and white striped cushions. In the background, a white sofa with blue and white pillows sits against the wall, below a framed painting of a reclining figure. Two sets of white double doors are visible, one open to reveal another room and one closed. A dark wood door is also visible on the right. A portion of a bed with white linens is visible in the bottom right corner.",
