On the walls are two framed black-and-white photographs: one on the left showing a person leaning over a railing, and one on the right showing a young child. A wooden door or partition is visible on the right side of the frame, partially obscuring the view. A small bottle with a wooden cap sits on the back of the toilet tank.",
