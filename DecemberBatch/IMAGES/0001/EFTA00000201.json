On the left, there is a small built-in wet bar area with a dark countertop and a gold-colored sink. The floor is covered with a long blue protective runner, and brown paper or plastic sheeting is visible along the baseboards on the right side, suggesting construction or moving activity. The hallway leads to a dark wooden door at the far end. Recessed lighting is visible in the ceiling.",
