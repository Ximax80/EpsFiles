The wall behind it has a light brown or beige color with decorative, stencil-like patterns resembling stylized leaves or branches. A white piece of paper with a large bold letter 'F' and a small grid/table below it is taped to the wall. To the right, a gold-colored curtain hangs vertically. In the bottom right foreground, a portion of a wooden chair or furniture piece is visible.",
