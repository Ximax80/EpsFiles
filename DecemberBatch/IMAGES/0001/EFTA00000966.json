Below the books is a flat-screen television and a small toaster oven. Underneath that shelf are two built-in microwave ovens mounted side-by-side. A dark gray countertop runs along the bottom, with white cabinetry underneath. In the background, a hallway with a hanging lantern-style light fixture is visible.",
