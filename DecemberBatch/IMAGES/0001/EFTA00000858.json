The walls are made of light-colored stone blocks. On both the left and right walls, large framed landscape paintings in an East Asian style are mounted on black metal hanging systems. To the left of the door, there is a red portable work light on a tripod. To the right of the door, there is a vertical panel with several small screens or intercom units. In the foreground, there are stone steps leading down to a black floor mat in front of the door. Metal handrails are visible on both sides of the stairs.",
