    "description": "An interior photograph of a room featuring a window and a door. The window is a white-framed, multi-pane casement style with a dark view outside, suggesting it is nighttime. To the left of the window, a long, cream-colored curtain hangs from a dark rod. To the right, a white door is partially open, revealing a gold-toned doorknob and a small circular lock above it. A white label with the letters 'FF' is taped to the door. The walls are a light gray or off-white color.",
