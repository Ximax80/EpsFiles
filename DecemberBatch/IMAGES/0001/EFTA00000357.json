In the center is a metal wire shelving unit stacked with various rolled items, including rugs, carpets, and what appears to be a white mattress or large foam pad wrapped in plastic. Below the shelving unit are several large cardboard boxes or furniture pieces partially covered in white padding and plastic. To the left, a brown chair has a yellow measuring tape resting on its seat. In the foreground, there is a light green plastic bin. The background shows white walls, a door, and a window with white blinds. A large metal duct or structural beam is visible on the right side.",
