    "description": "A high-angle photograph showing a gilded, ornate console table with a marble top. A white evidence marker with a large black letter 'D' is taped to the front edge of the table. Underneath the table, two small, brownish, rounded sculptures or objects are visible on the floor. On top of the marble surface, a portion of a picture frame and a decorative base of an object (possibly a clock or statue) are visible. The floor is light-colored tile with dark diamond-shaped accents.",
