The space features dark wood paneling and cabinetry on the left, a white wall in the center, and a dark wood door with a circular porthole-style window. The floor is covered with a tan, vertically striped carpet. A simple dome light fixture is mounted on the ceiling. To the left, there is a built-in cabinet with glass doors and drawers below a marble countertop.
