The desk is cluttered with various items including tissues, pens, and cleaning supplies. To the left, a portion of a large painting showing a person's legs in red high heels is visible, along with a framed document on the wall. In the background, there is a doorway leading to another room and long grey curtains. On the right wall, there is an electrical box and a wall-mounted light fixture.",
