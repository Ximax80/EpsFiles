    "description": "An interior photograph of a room, likely an office or storage area. The room features beige walls and grey striped carpeting. On the left wall, there are white shelves and a white wall-mounted file organizer containing several folders with colored labels. A large cardboard box sits on the floor in the foreground. In the center, an open doorway leads to another room where electrical panels or equipment are visible. To the right, a white door is partially open, and a silver Rimowa-style suitcase with a yellow sticky note stands against the wall next to a wire mesh trash can.",
