    "description": "A photograph of a massage or spa treatment room. In the center is a massage table covered with a white sheet and a blue folded towel. To the left is a large, ornate wooden cabinet with glass-less shelves filled with various bottles, jars, and spa products. The cabinet features decorative carvings of figures on its pillars. The walls are covered in a dark, patterned wallpaper. To the right of the massage table is a large painting depicting a nude figure lying amidst debris. In the background, an open doorway reveals a dark, possibly marble-lined interior room. A bright light source or piece of equipment is visible in the upper right foreground, partially obscuring the view.",
