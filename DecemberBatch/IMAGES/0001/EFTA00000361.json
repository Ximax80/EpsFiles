    "description": "A photograph of an interior utility or storage area. The image shows a vertical structural column or duct with two grey electrical boxes (likely damper actuators or control boxes) mounted on it. Black electrical wires run between the boxes and into the wall. A small plastic bag containing a brownish substance is hanging from a string tied to one of the wires. To the left, there are wooden shelves containing boxes and small parts in plastic bags. There is a small patch of missing paint or damage on the central column.",
