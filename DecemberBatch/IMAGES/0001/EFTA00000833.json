    "description": "A photograph of a bathroom or dressing area that appears to be under investigation or in a state of disarray. A large, dark gray safe sits on the floor in the center-left, covered in a light-colored dust or powder. Several black boxes and a yellow padded envelope are stacked on the floor next to the safe. The floor is covered in a gray cloth or tarp, also covered in dust. To the right is a vanity with a dark countertop, a sink, and several drawers. On the vanity are various toiletries and a white towel. In the background, a mirrored door reflects a brightly lit area with a chair, suggesting a vanity or dressing room. The walls are light-colored with decorative molding.",
