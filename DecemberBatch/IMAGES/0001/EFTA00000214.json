A bright blue carpet with black stripes along the edges runs down the center of the hall. On the left wall, there is a large framed black and white portrait. On the right wall, there is a small framed landscape painting and a light switch or control panel. The hallway leads through a doorway into another room or hallway with lighter-colored walls and ceiling fixtures.",
