    "description": "A photograph of a bathroom interior. The image shows a vanity with a marble countertop and white cabinetry on the left. Above the vanity is a large mirror and a smaller, wall-mounted circular magnifying mirror. To the right of the vanity is a shower stall with a glass door and marble-tiled walls and floor. A white door with a brass-colored knob is partially visible in the foreground on the right, framing the view into the bathroom. The overall color palette is neutral, featuring whites, creams, and grey-veined marble.",
    "layout": "The photograph is taken from a slightly low angle, looking into the bathroom through a doorway. The vanity is on the left, the shower is in the center-right, and a door edge is on the far right.",
