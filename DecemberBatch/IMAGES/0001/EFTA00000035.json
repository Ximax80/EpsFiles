A white leather sofa and a matching white leather armchair are present. A large, curved white built-in bookshelf is filled with numerous books and a digital clock showing '7:45'. In the foreground, there is a glass coffee table covered with various books and a bowl of colorful items (possibly candy). A computer monitor and desk lamp are visible on the left edge. A decorative shield or tribal artifact is mounted high on the wall above the bookshelf.",
