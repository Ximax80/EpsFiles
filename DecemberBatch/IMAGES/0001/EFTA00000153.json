    "description": "A high-resolution photograph of an opulent, wood-paneled room, likely a study or library. The room features a dark blue ceiling, a large ornate gold and crystal chandelier, and walls covered in dark wood paneling and large tapestries. A large patterned area rug covers the floor. In the center is a gold-colored geometric desk/table with stacks of books. Various pieces of furniture are visible, including upholstered chairs, a white sofa, and small side tables with lamps. Notably, a taxidermy tiger is lying on the rug in the lower right foreground. To the far right, a portion of an ornate, dark cabinet with inlaid patterns is visible.",
