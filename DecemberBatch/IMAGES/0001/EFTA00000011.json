    "description": "A photograph of a large Japanese folding screen (byōbu) mounted on a light-colored stone or tiled wall. The screen depicts a landscape featuring a large, snow-capped mountain (likely Mount Fuji) in the background, with a foreground of water, trees, and small landmasses in a traditional ink-wash style. The screen is framed in dark wood and is suspended by a black metal hanging apparatus consisting of a horizontal bar and vertical rods. There is a small red seal and black calligraphy on the far right panel.",
