A large, circular metal gong is mounted on a wooden frame in the foreground. The walls are decorated with a light-colored mural depicting trees and mountains in an East Asian style. A framed portrait of an elderly man with a long beard hangs above a dark fireplace mantel. To the left, there is a small whiteboard on an easel with some diagrams or writing. The floor is covered with a neutral-toned striped carpet.",
