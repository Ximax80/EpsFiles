    "description": "A high-angle, eye-level photograph of a narrow, galley-style kitchen and breakfast bar area. The kitchen features white cabinetry, dark countertops (possibly granite or soapstone), and hardwood flooring. On the left, a curved breakfast bar with a white base and a single white modern barstool is visible. A large, ornate black lantern-style pendant light hangs over the bar. On the wall behind the bar, there is a decorative ceramic plate and a dark wood door with a circular porthole window. To the right, the main kitchen area includes a stainless steel range hood, a dark stovetop, and white upper and lower cabinets. A large white refrigerator is partially visible in the foreground on the right. A water cooler with a blue 'Poland Spring' bottle is in the bottom left foreground. A clock is mounted on the far wall above a window.",
