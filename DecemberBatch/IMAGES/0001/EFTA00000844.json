    "description": "A street-level photograph taken in New York City during rainy or overcast weather. The foreground is dominated by the roof of a dark grey vehicle. Behind it, several yellow taxis and a red double-decker tour bus are visible in traffic. A street sign pole in the center identifies the intersection as E 71 St. In the background, there is a dense line of green trees and a classical-style stone building on the left. A digital advertisement for 'MEAN GIRLS ON BROADWAY' is visible on top of one of the taxis. A traffic light shows a red signal.",
