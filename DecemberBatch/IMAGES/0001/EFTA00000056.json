    "description": "An interior photograph of a luxurious, ornate living room or parlor. The room features white walls with gold-leaf molding, a white marble fireplace with gold accents, and several pieces of high-end furniture. In the center is a black octagonal table with a chess set. Surrounding the table are four plush, white armchairs. To the left, a staircase with an ornate black wrought-iron railing is visible. On the walls are large, gold-framed mirrors and a portrait painting above the fireplace. Two gold console tables with lamps are positioned against the walls. A large white object, possibly a sculpture or lamp base, is in the immediate foreground, partially obscuring the left side of the frame.",
