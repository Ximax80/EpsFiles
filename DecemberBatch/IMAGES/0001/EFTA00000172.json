To the right, there is a vanity area with several jars of cosmetic or grooming products. Above the vanity is a vertical light fixture with four round bulbs and a mirror. On the left wall, a small framed piece of art is hanging. A decorative screen or tapestry is partially visible on the far left edge.",
