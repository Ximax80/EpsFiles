A large bed is the central focus, dressed with white pillows and a grey and black faux-fur striped throw blanket. The headboard is ornate with a scalloped pink velvet border and a striped fabric center. Two matching floor lamps with red shades flank the bed. To the left, there are two windows with white curtains that have a thin blue decorative border. The floor appears to have yellow carpeting.",
