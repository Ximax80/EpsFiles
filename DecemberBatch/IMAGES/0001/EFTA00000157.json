On the wall at the top of the stairs, there are two fire extinguishers (one red, one black) mounted together. Above the extinguishers is a sign that reads '3RD FLOOR'. There is a circular wall light to the left of the extinguishers and a smoke detector on the ceiling. A white vertical column or structural element is visible to the right of the extinguishers.",
