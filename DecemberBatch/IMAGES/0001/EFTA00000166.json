    "description": "An interior photograph of a room that appears to be a massage or treatment room. The room features dark, patterned wallpaper and gold-toned molding. In the center is a massage table covered with a white sheet and a folded blue towel. On the left, there is a small side table with various bottles (lotions, oils), a white container, and a white telephone. The walls are decorated with several pieces of art, including a large painting of a nude figure lying upside down amidst debris, and two smaller framed photographs of nude or semi-nude figures. Some parts of the artwork have been redacted with black boxes. To the left, an open doorway reveals a dark, marble-tiled bathroom area.",
