    "description": "A photograph of an interior hallway or room featuring ornate, gilded furniture. In the foreground, there is a marble-topped console table with gold-colored legs and decorative carvings. On the table sits a large ornate lamp with a pleated shade, a white candle in a glass jar, and a framed photograph of a person (the face is redacted with a black box). A white evidence marker with a large black letter 'D' is taped to the front of the table. Below the table are two rounded, stone-like decorative objects. In the background, there is a marble fireplace with gold accents and another similar console table further down the hallway. The floor is light-colored tile with dark diamond-shaped inserts.",
