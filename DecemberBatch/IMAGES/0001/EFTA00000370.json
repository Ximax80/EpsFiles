    "description": "An interior photograph of a modern, well-furnished office or study area that transitions into a lounge space. In the foreground, there is a gray armchair and a colorful, curved desk with a bright blue top, red trim, and yellow supports. On the desk sits a computer monitor, a lamp with a sculptural base, and various papers and small frames. In the background, there is a living area with dark leather armchairs, a white sofa, a patterned rug, and several pieces of framed art on the walls. The right wall consists of frosted glass panels. The lighting is dim, likely from the desk lamp and overhead recessed lights.",
