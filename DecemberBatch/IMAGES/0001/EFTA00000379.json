    "description": "A photograph of a grey metal door set into a recessed frame within a light-colored wall. To the left of the door is a large, vertical red pipe. The door has a silver doorknob and a hydraulic door closer at the top. A horizontal black strip (possibly tape or a magnetic sensor bar) is affixed across the middle of the door and onto the frame. The floor at the base of the door appears to be concrete or unfinished. A small white electrical outlet or switch is visible on the wall to the right of the door.",
