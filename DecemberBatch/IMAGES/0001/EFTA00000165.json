A massage table covered with a white sheet and blue towels is in the foreground. On the walls are several framed pictures of nude or semi-nude women, with faces and some body parts redacted with black boxes. A large painting of a nude woman looking into a mirror is on the right. There is a medical or treatment device on a stand, a set of black folding chairs, and a small shelf with blue towels and a blue bottle.",
