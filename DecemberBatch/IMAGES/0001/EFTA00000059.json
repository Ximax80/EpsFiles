    "description": "A photograph of a luxurious bathroom interior. The foreground features a large marble-topped vanity with an undermount sink and gold-toned fixtures. On the vanity are various items including a white candle, a soap dispenser, and a dark decorative object. Above the vanity is a large mirror reflecting the opposite side of the room. Two wall-mounted sconces provide warm lighting. To the right, a doorway leads to another section of the bathroom where a toilet is visible. On the back wall of that room hangs a large piece of art depicting a zebra-like figure in a dynamic pose. The walls are covered in a patterned wallpaper, and the flooring appears to be polished stone or tile. A wicker basket sits under the vanity, and a small rug is on the floor.",
