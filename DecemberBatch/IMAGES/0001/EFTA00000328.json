    "description": "An interior photograph of a room, likely a bedroom or dressing area, featuring white paneled doors, a vanity, and a window. A gray armchair sits near a white-framed window with four panes. To the right of the window is a white vanity cabinet with a marble top, holding various toiletries and a small circular mirror. Above the vanity is a wall-mounted lamp with a beige shade and a larger mirror. A white door is partially open on the right, leading into a closet or storage area with white shelving and storage boxes. Another white door is visible in the foreground on the left, partially obscuring the view. The walls are painted a dark color, possibly black or dark navy, above white wainscoting. The floor is covered in a light-colored patterned carpet.",
