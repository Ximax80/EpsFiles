The wood around the latch and lock area is splintered and gouged, suggesting a forced entry. The doors feature ornate brass hardware, including a long rectangular push plate on the left door and a matching plate on the right door with a 'Medeco' brand lock cylinder and a decorative, rope-patterned door knob. The wood has a dark, vertical grain.",
