    "description": "A photograph taken through an open doorway looking into a small kitchen or kitchenette area. The kitchen features white cabinetry, a stainless steel sink with a high-arc faucet, a white countertop, and a stainless steel dishwasher. A window with multiple panes is centered above the sink, showing a dark exterior and a reflection of an interior light fixture. On the counter, there is a dish rack, soap dispensers, a roll of paper towels, and a toaster. A white door is visible on the left side of the frame, partially open, with a small white sign or label attached to it. The walls and trim are white.",
