    "description": "A high-end interior room, likely a living room or salon in a luxury residence. The room features white walls with gold-leaf molding, a marble fireplace with gold accents, and a large portrait of a man with a yellow-toned face above the mantel. Two ornate gold-framed mirrors flank the fireplace, each above a gold console table with lamps. In the foreground, there is a white plush armchair and a black octagonal table with a chess set. The floor is light-colored stone or marble with dark diamond-shaped inlays. A staircase with an ornate black and gold railing is visible on the left, and an open doorway leads to another room on the right.",
