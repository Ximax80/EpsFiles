On the left, there is a stainless steel sink, a range with a griddle, and a vent hood. On the right, a long counter with white cabinets underneath extends into the foreground, with a black lantern-style pendant light hanging above it. In the background, there is a smaller prep area with a sink, a water cooler, and more white cabinetry. Recessed lighting and a smoke detector are visible on the ceiling.",
