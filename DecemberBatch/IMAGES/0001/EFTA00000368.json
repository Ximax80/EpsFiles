The kitchen features light-colored (off-white or cream) cabinetry, a granite or stone countertop with a brown/tan speckled pattern, and a stainless steel dishwasher. A stainless steel sink with a high-arc faucet is visible. On the counter, there is a coffee maker, a small white object (possibly a clock or scale), a jar, and a roll of paper towels. A stainless steel trash can sits on the light wood flooring in the foreground. The ceiling has recessed lighting.",
