The room features cream-colored paneled walls with decorative trim, including a vertical border with a repeating dolphin or wave motif.

On the counter, several toiletries and a white towel are visible. Two wall-mounted lamps with cream shades are positioned between the mirrors. To the right, an open doorway leads to another room where a white chair with dark armrests is partially visible. A decorative chandelier hangs from the ceiling in the upper right corner.",
