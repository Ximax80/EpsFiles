    "description": "A high-angle photograph of an interior room featuring a grand wooden staircase with ornate wrought-iron railings. In the foreground, there is a seating area with four white, plush armchairs arranged around a small, ornate circular table that has a chessboard on top. Behind the seating area is a long dark wood console table against a white wall, decorated with several sculptures, including two white stylized heads and a dark organic-shaped object. The ceiling features decorative molding with gold accents and a painted mural of a blue sky with clouds. A white cord or rope hangs from the ceiling near the top of the stairs.",
