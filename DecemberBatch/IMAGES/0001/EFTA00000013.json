    "description": "A photograph of an interior hallway or entryway. The focal point is a large, arched double wooden door at the end of the corridor. The walls are made of light-colored stone blocks. On both the left and right walls, there are large, horizontal landscape paintings in a traditional East Asian style (sumi-e style), depicting mountains and trees. The painting on the left features a prominent snow-capped mountain resembling Mount Fuji. Modern black track lighting is mounted above the paintings. To the right of the door, there are four small electronic control panels or screens mounted vertically on the wall.",
