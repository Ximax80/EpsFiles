The walls and a built-in bench are made of black marble with prominent white and gold veining. To the left, a mirror is visible with a vertical light fixture containing three glowing round bulbs. In the foreground on the left, there are some plastic bottles or containers. On the right, a patterned robe (maroon with gold circular patterns and a green hood) hangs on a hook near a doorway or glass enclosure framed in gold-toned metal. A bright flash reflection is visible on the back marble wall.",
