    "description": "A photograph of a mechanical room or utility space, likely an HVAC or boiler room. The image shows a complex network of insulated pipes (white), copper piping, electrical conduits, and large metal ductwork. A grey electrical control panel is mounted on a metal frame in the center. In the background, a large blue mechanical unit with a pulley wheel is visible. A grey bucket sits on the floor. To the left, there is a dark blue or black curved panel with some yellow markings. A white cabinet is on the far right.",
