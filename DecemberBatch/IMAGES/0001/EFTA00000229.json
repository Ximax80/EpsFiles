    "description": "A photograph of a bathroom interior. On the wall, which is covered in vertical striped wallpaper (pink, yellow, green, and white), there is a large painting. The painting depicts a nude woman sitting on the ground next to a basket of fruit, with a partially visible man in a suit behind her; the style appears to be a modern interpretation or copy of Édouard Manet's 'Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe'. Below the painting is a white towel rack holding two folded white towels. To the left is an open white door with a brass handle and a silver latch plate. To the right is a reflective surface, likely a mirror or glass shower door frame.",
