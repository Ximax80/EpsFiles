    "description": "A photograph of a bedroom interior. The walls are painted a vibrant purple/periwinkle color with white crown molding. In the foreground, a bed is partially visible with a black and white striped faux-fur throw blanket. To the right, there is a grey wooden dresser holding a Vizio television, a gold-framed mirror, a small stuffed lion, and some tissues. Two black wooden chairs are positioned against the wall between the dresser and an open doorway. The doorway leads to a hallway or another room with white doors and gold-colored hardware. A lamp with a stained-glass style shade is visible in the reflection of the mirror.",
