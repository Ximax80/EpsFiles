    "description": "A photograph of a bedroom interior. The room features vibrant purple walls and yellow carpeting. A bed is the central focus, made with white sheets and a black and white striped faux-fur or patterned throw blanket. The headboard is ornate with a scalloped pink border and multi-colored striped fabric center. To the right of the bed is a dark bedside table holding a blue stained-glass Tiffany-style lamp and some papers. A wall-mounted lamp with a red shade is visible on the left side of the headboard, and another similar lamp is positioned behind the bedside table. A white door frame is visible on the far right.",
