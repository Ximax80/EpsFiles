    "description": "A photograph of a luxurious interior hallway or landing. The space features dark wood parquet flooring in a geometric pattern. To the right is a low wooden bookshelf filled with books, topped with a large blue and white ceramic vase and other decorative items. Above the bookshelf is a large, antiqued mirror wall. A leopard-print armchair sits near the mirror. In the background, an ornate doorway with gold leaf trim leads to another room where a hanging lantern is visible. A dark wood door is partially visible in the distance. To the left, a metal railing with a dark wood handrail suggests a staircase.",
