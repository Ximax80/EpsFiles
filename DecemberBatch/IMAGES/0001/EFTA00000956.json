On the counter, there is a silver tea set on a tray, some small white dishes, a tray with various bottles and jars (including what appears to be a container of 'CEL' brand wipes or powder), and other small items. To the left, an open doorway leads into a long, dimly lit hallway with multiple doors and hardwood flooring. A single recessed light is visible on the ceiling.",
