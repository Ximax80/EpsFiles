    "description": "An interior photograph of a grand staircase leading to an open doorway. The staircase is made of light-colored stone or marble. On either side of the stairs are large, framed landscape paintings in a traditional East Asian style. A metal handrail runs along both sides of the stairs. At the top of the stairs, to the left of the door, is a white umbrella stand containing several black umbrellas. The doorway is framed by a heavy, dark wood door with ornate paneling and a circular decorative element at the bottom. Through the open door, a glimpse of another room with a chandelier and further corridors is visible. The walls are constructed of large, light-colored stone blocks.",
