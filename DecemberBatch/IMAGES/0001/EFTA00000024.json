A large mirror is mounted on the wall above the sink, reflecting a doorway and a light fixture in another room. To the right of the sink is a glass-enclosed shower stall with marble-patterned tiling at the base. The floor is covered in small white square tiles. A toothbrush and toothpaste are visible on the edge of the sink.",
