    "description": "A night-time photograph of a narrow outdoor balcony or terrace. The space features several large, square, grey planters. Two planters in the background contain small, slender trees with dense green foliage. Two planters in the foreground contain flowering plants (hydrangeas) with pale green and brownish blooms. The floor is tiled with light-colored square pavers. To the left is a stone or concrete wall with a classic-style outdoor lantern mounted on it. To the right is a low wall or parapet that appears to have a painted mural of a blue sky with white clouds on its inner surface. The background beyond the balcony is dark, suggesting it is night.",
