    "description": "A photograph of an industrial or mechanical room, likely a basement or utility area. The scene is dominated by a complex network of insulated pipes and metal ductwork. Many of the pipes are wrapped in white insulation and feature yellow labels indicating their function. The ductwork is made of galvanized sheet metal. In the foreground, a blue metal ladder or stand is partially visible. The floor is concrete, and the lighting is artificial and somewhat harsh, casting strong shadows.",
