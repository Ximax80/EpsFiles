    "description": "A photograph of an interior storage or utility room. The central focus is a white wall containing two large, rectangular electrical panel covers. To the left of the panels, a red fire extinguisher is mounted on the wall. To the right, there is a storage area with metal shelving units holding rolls of fabric or rugs. A brown chair and several boxes, including a green one, are visible in the foreground and background. The lighting appears to be from an overhead fluorescent fixture.",
