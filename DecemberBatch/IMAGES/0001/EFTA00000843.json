The main building features a light-colored stone facade with arched windows and a large wooden double-door entrance. Several cars are parked along the curb, including a white station wagon in the foreground, a black Audi sedan, and a grey SUV. Construction barriers (orange) are visible further down the street. There are trees lining the sidewalk, and some white artifacts/spots are visible on the image, possibly rain or lens flare.",
