    "description": "A street-level photograph of a large, ornate stone building, likely a townhouse or embassy, in an urban setting. The building features large arched windows with black iron grilles and a prominent wooden double-door entrance. Several cars are parked along the curb in the foreground, including a grey SUV, a black sedan, and a white station wagon. There is construction equipment in the lower right, including orange plastic barriers and orange safety netting. Two individuals with their faces redacted (blacked out) are walking toward the building's entrance. A person in a blue shirt is visible behind the construction netting. Large leafy trees line the sidewalk.",
