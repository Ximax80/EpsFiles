The room features a large rectangular table covered with a floral-patterned tablecloth, surrounded by several chairs upholstered in a leopard-print fabric. On the table, there is a vase of white flowers and some small objects. In the foreground, the back of a bronze-colored bust on a pedestal is visible. The walls are decorated with a light-colored mural depicting stylized clouds and flowering branches. There are dark wood doors and a sideboard in the background, which holds various framed photographs and items. A white flipchart or board is also visible in the background.",
