To the left, an open doorway reveals a room with a dark carpet and a large painting on the wall. The painting depicts a woman in a blue dress sitting in a chair. To the right of the doorway, a staircase descends, marked by a dark metal handrail. On the wall above the stairs, a large framed artwork is partially visible, hanging from black cords.
