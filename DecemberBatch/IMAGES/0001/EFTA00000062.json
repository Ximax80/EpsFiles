    "description": "A photograph of an ornate, antique-style clock resting on a tall pedestal. The clock is made of gold-toned metal (likely bronze or brass) and features two classical figures (possibly a man and a woman) reclining or leaning against the clock face. The clock face has Roman numerals. The pedestal is made of dark, veined marble (possibly black or dark blue) with gold-toned decorative metal accents, including a central crest and corner borders. The clock and pedestal are positioned in a corner of a room with striped and patterned wallpaper. The floor appears to be a grey stone or granite tile.",
