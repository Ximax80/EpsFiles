On the wall at the landing, there are two fire extinguishers mounted below a sign that reads 'ROOF LEVEL'. Below the extinguishers is a white electronic box with wires hanging down, including a power plug that is not connected to an outlet. A red fire suppression pipe runs horizontally across the upper part of the wall. There is a ceiling light, a smoke detector, and a recessed panel on the right wall.",
