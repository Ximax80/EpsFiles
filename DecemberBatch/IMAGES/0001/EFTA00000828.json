    "description": "A photograph of an interior hallway or entryway. The scene features a large, arched wooden double door at the end of a corridor. On the left and right walls, there are large, horizontal landscape paintings in a traditional East Asian style (possibly Japanese ink wash paintings) depicting mountains and trees. The walls are made of light-colored stone blocks. In the foreground, there are metal handrails on both sides leading down a small set of stairs to a dark rectangular floor mat in front of the door. A dark garment, possibly a jacket or coat, is hanging from the center handle of the wooden doors.",
