Inside the room, there is a black rolling tool chest or cart with various items stacked on top, including what appear to be plastic storage bins. A gray rectangular panel, likely an electrical breaker box, is mounted on the wall. A white plastic shopping bag with text is on the carpeted floor. The lighting is provided by an overhead fixture, part of which is visible at the top of the frame.",
