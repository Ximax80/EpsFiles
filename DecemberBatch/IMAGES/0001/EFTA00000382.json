    "description": "A high-angle photograph looking down a carpeted staircase. The stairs lead to a landing with grey carpeting. On the wall at the bottom of the stairs, there is a red fire extinguisher mounted next to a white pipe. To the right of the extinguisher is a recessed wall cabinet containing what appears to be fire hoses or emergency equipment behind a glass or mesh door. The staircase has a blue-painted metal railing with a wooden handrail. The walls are white, and there are some dark scuff marks or smudges on the wall to the left of the stairs.",
