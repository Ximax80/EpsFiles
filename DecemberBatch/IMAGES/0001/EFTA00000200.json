    "description": "A photograph showing the interior of a small closet or wardrobe area. Inside, there is a top shelf holding a white hat with Cyrillic text, folded blue floral fabric, a dark cap, and a gold crown-like object. Below the shelf is a brass hanging rod with several garments on hangers, including long black robes (one with gold embroidery), a white scarf, and a white polo shirt with a red stripe on the sleeve. On the floor of the closet are several pairs of shoes, including traditional woven slippers (lapti), tall felt boots (valenki) with red embroidery, several pairs of leather sandals/slippers, and a brown rectangular bag. To the right, a mirror reflects the closet interior and a portion of the room, including a white electrical outlet on the wall.",
