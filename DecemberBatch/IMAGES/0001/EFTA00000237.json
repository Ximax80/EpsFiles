The hallway features patterned blue and green plaid carpeting. To the left, heavy cream-colored curtains with a blue floral pattern and red trim are draped. A small wooden chair with a patterned seat is visible further down the hall. On the right wall, several framed architectural drawings or sketches are hung. The lighting is artificial, likely from a ceiling fixture.",
