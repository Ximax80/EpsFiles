    "description": "A photograph of a small bathroom or water closet. The room features cream-colored paneled walls. A modern white toilet with a bidet-style lid is centered. To the left, there is a toilet paper stand holding two rolls and a toilet brush. To the right, a wall-mounted toilet paper holder and a towel rack with white towels are visible. Two framed pictures hang on the walls; the one on the left shows a beach scene with palm trees and a vehicle, while the one on the right is partially visible. Both pictures have black redaction squares covering portions of the image.",
