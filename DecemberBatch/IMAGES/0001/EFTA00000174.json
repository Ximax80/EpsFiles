    "description": "A photograph of a long, narrow interior hallway. The walls are painted a neutral taupe or beige color. The floor is covered with a patterned beige carpet runner. On the left wall, several framed black-and-white photographs are hung. A low, upholstered bench with a dark patterned fabric and black fringe sits against the left wall. On the right wall, there is another framed photograph and a doorway. The hallway leads through a series of open doorways into further rooms, where a white dresser and a dark chair are visible in the distance. Two large, tiered fabric light fixtures hang from the ceiling.",
