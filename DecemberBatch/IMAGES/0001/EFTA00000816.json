    "description": "A photograph of a small storage or office room. The room has beige walls and a grey carpeted floor. On the left is a white paneled door. Along the back and right walls are white adjustable shelving units. The shelves are mostly empty but contain a few items: a roll of tan material (possibly a rug or mat), two black rectangular blocks, some white plastic bags, a green bubble-wrapped item, and some red fabric on the top shelf. A white modern office chair with horizontal ribbing and chrome arms is positioned in the center. On the floor, there is a cardboard box, a white plastic bucket, and another flattened cardboard box. A white vertical document organizer is mounted on the far right wall.",
