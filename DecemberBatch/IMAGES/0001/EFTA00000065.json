    "description": "A high-angle photograph of an ornate dining or conference room. The room features a large rectangular table covered with a floral-patterned tablecloth. Several chairs upholstered in a leopard-print fabric are arranged around the table. On the left wall, there is a large framed portrait of an elderly man with a long beard, set above a dark fireplace mantel. The walls are decorated with a subtle, light-colored mural depicting mountains and clouds. To the right, there is a window with heavy beige curtains, a tall candelabra, and a sideboard with various items including flowers and a telephone. A yellow tape measure and some papers are visible on the table.",
