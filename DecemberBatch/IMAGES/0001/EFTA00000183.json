    "description": "A photograph of a large, circular white bathtub set into a light-colored stone or marble surround. The bathroom features stone block walls. Several decorative items are placed around the rim of the tub, including a large glass hurricane lamp with a yellow candle, a red ceramic vase, a blue glass bottle with a red stopper, and a bronze-colored bust of a woman. A mirror with a dark, ornate frame is visible on the left, reflecting the scene. A beige curtain hangs partially across an opening or window behind the tub. In the background, some items appear to be covered in plastic sheeting, suggesting construction or storage.",
