    "description": "A photograph of a large, ancient-style sculpture depicting a lion attacking a stag or deer. The sculpture appears to be made of stone or terracotta with a weathered, light-brown finish. The lion is positioned on top of the stag, biting its neck. The stag's head is tilted back in a cry of distress. The entire sculpture is mounted on a black triangular base, which sits on a polished wooden surface. The background consists of mirrored panels reflecting a grand room with classical architectural details, including columns and a decorative frieze near the ceiling. To the left, a gold-colored ornate candelabra is partially visible.",
