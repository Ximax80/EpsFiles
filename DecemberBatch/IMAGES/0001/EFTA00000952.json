On the left, there is a built-in dark wood cabinet system featuring upper cabinets, a marble countertop with a small backsplash, and lower drawers. On the countertop, there are metal wire racks or stands. The walls are a light, off-white color with a subtle texture. The floor is covered in a tan and brown striped carpet. Dark wood crown molding and baseboards frame the room. To the right, a dark wood door frame is visible.",
