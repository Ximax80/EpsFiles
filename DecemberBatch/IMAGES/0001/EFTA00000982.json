    "description": "A photograph showing the interior of a walk-in closet or storage area. The walls are lined with horizontal cedar wood planks. A metal clothing rod runs horizontally across the frame, holding several jackets and coats on wooden hangers. The garments include denim jackets, a white puffer coat, and several dark-colored jackets. Below the hanging clothes, several pairs of shoes and boots are visible on the floor, including blue suede shoes and light-colored winter boots. A white rectangular storage box with a glass front is mounted on the wall above the rod. To the right, a doorway leads to another room with white paneled walls and a wall-mounted candle sconce. A light switch is visible on the cedar wall near the door frame.",
