    "description": "A high-quality interior photograph of a grand staircase. The stairs are made of light-colored stone or marble. A dark metal handrail runs along the right side, supported by thin vertical posts. The walls are constructed of large, light-colored stone blocks. On the wall above the staircase hangs a large framed horizontal painting depicting a snowy mountain (resembling Mount Fuji) with dark pine trees in the foreground. To the left, there is a dark wood door with ornate circular detailing and a smaller doorway leading to another room.",
    "layout": "The photograph is taken from a low angle looking up the stairs. The painting dominates the upper right quadrant, while the stairs lead the eye from the bottom left towards the center.",
