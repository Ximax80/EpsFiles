To the right of the sink is a brown trash bin. Behind the sink is a bathtub with a sliding glass shower door. Two white towels are hanging over the towel bar on the shower door. The shower walls are lined with grey marble tiles. A wall-mounted light fixture is visible above the sink next to a black-framed mirror.
