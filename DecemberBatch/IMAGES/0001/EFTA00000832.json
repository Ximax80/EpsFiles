    "description": "A photograph showing the interior of a dressing room or vanity area. The room features ornate, cream-colored paneled walls with decorative carvings. A large built-in vanity desk with a marble or light-colored top is centered, featuring multiple drawers and a large mirror behind it. On the desk are various items including two lamps with pleated shades, small sculptures, a white box, and grooming supplies. A white salon-style chair and a pink striped chair are in the foreground. To the right, there is a dark-colored ottoman or storage chest with several black boxes and a brown envelope resting on it. The lighting appears to be from an internal flash, creating a bright spot in the mirror on the right.",
