    "description": "A photograph taken from a doorway looking into a walk-in closet. The closet has cedar wood plank walls and a dark wood parquet floor with a geometric pattern. A single round light fixture is mounted on the ceiling. There are two hanging rods: one in the back and one on the right side, both filled with various coats and jackets. Several pairs of shoes and boots are lined up on the floor against the back wall. A small white piece of paper is taped to the right wall above the clothes rack. The doorway is framed by white trim.",
