    "description": "A photograph of a security or monitoring workstation. The scene includes a white L-shaped desk with two black mesh office chairs. On the desk are three small computer monitors, and mounted above them on the wall is a large array of four flat-screen televisions/monitors in a 2x2 grid. Various items are on the desk, including a keyboard, two mice, a box of tissues, a bottle of vitamins (labeled 'womens'), a water bottle (labeled 'VOSS'), and some papers. To the right, on the wall, there is a security control panel with lights and a red fire alarm pull station. A grey curtain covers a window on the left side of the image.",
