    "description": "A low-angle photograph of a multi-story limestone or light-colored stone townhouse. The building features ornate architectural details including arched entryways with decorative carvings (gargoyles or faces), large rectangular windows with dark frames, and a central balcony with an intricate black wrought-iron railing. Several leafy green trees in the foreground partially obscure the facade. The building style is reminiscent of Beaux-Arts or French Renaissance architecture common in New York City's Upper East Side.",
