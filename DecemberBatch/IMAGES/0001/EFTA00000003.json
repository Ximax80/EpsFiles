    "description": "A photograph of a multi-story limestone or light-colored stone building, likely a townhouse or mansion. The building features large arched windows on the ground floor with black iron bars, a central arched wooden double door with a hanging lantern above it, and rectangular windows on the upper floors. A decorative wrought-iron balcony spans the width of the central windows on the second floor. Two large trees with green foliage partially obscure the facade. A dark-colored car is parked in the foreground on the right side. The lighting suggests it is either dusk or an overcast day.",
