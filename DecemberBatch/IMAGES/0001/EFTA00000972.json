    "description": "A photograph of a white built-in cabinetry unit, likely in a residential or office setting. The counter is cluttered with various items including a large 'Bonpoint' shopping bag containing a dark, curved object (possibly a cane or umbrella handle), several medicine bottles, a framed picture, a cardboard Amazon box, and stacks of papers. Above the counter, there are white cabinets with gold-toned knobs. A first aid/AED instructional poster and an AED sign are affixed to the upper cabinet doors. To the right, another section of cabinetry holds a printer and more papers. A large 'H' sign is taped to an upper cabinet door on the right.",
